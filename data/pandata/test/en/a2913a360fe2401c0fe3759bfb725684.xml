		<document><![CDATA[@StephenAMcMahon That's one of the key reasons why we need proper supports
no one can care for someone with a complex disease without training, without support and often 24/7 - we end up with 2 ill people We need everyday supports &amp; properly trained family &amp; professional carers]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LydieSM @CarersTrust @BBCNews Totally agree - so much focus on childcare and so little focus on those of us who have had to care for parents or other relatives. Family carers save the State millions with proper home supports we could do both]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@sinead_ryan @SimonHarrisTD @jimdalytd @HSELive 1. With respect I disagree. Research shows that people do best in their own home. Particularly important for people with dementia who need the familiarity that a lifelong home brings. If people want to live in a Ret home that's fine but it is segregation by age.]]></document>

But if you want to remain in your own home within the integrated community with people of all ages then you should be able to do that with proper community supports]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MaireCorbett @jimdalytd @alzheimersocirl @ALONE_IRELAND @AgeAction @activeirl @Age_Opp @AgeFriendlyIrl Fine if that's what you choose.

Seems like a double standard to me, that's all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@eosull @colettebrowne @barbarascully @ciarakellydoc 1/2 it was factual rather than disingenuous I was not referring to all men as a minority but rather quoting the flip side of the original tweet - if women are in the majority for xmas work then that means men who do this work are in the minority.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gemeroo I agree, My point though is that by giving a 'shout out' to women only you play into gendered roles &amp; continue supporting the inequality However if you commend everyone who does it males &amp; females you encourage more equality does that make sense?

		<document><![CDATA[@ciarakellydoc @colettebrowne @barbarascully I was referring to the men who do pull xmas together Tthey are by reference to the original tweet in the minority.

		<document><![CDATA[@colettebrowne @barbarascully @ciarakellydoc I don't agree - if you want to get more equality in the home/Christmas prep then acknowledge all who do the work not just the women. To only acknowledge the women entrenches the 'gendered role']]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@barbarascully @ciarakellydoc I also think it's good to have these conversations  - but important not to make presumptions about where people are coming from.

		<document><![CDATA[@barbarascully @ciarakellydoc I was referring to the presumption that ingrained patriarchy was the reason people were annoyed by your tweet. It wasn't the reason in my family. I think many men have reached their threshold after a year of being painted in bad light Your tweet may well have been a last straw]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@barbarascully @ciarakellydoc Have you asked any of them why they are insulted? The men in my house were insulted by the tweet. They felt it was divisive &amp; tars all men with a 'lazy' brush. My son in a same sex marriage, felt negated - where does that leave their xmas efforts?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@barbarascully @ciarakellydoc Why not just say yay to the people who pulled Christmas together? That's the point. The essence of equality is to ensure that minorities are treated equally so by ignoring the minority (men) in this instance who pull xmas together you go against those fundamental principles.]]></document>
