		<document><![CDATA[4/ Stan has impressed us with his level of thought about the technical issues that SKALE needs to solve. He had the foresight to build using a novel consensus algorithm that is both leaderless and fully asynchronous, which are paramount traits for a chains w/ small validator sets]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ As founders, Jack and Stan have blown us away. They are one of the most well rounded teams in the space, bringing decades of operational experience in tech startups to crypto. They know how to execute: raise money, recruit, define product vision, deliver on a schedule, etc]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ We've spoken to a number of teams in this space, and found that Jack and Stan had the clearest vision not only for how to implement the EVM on plasma, but how to build a robust network of chains that can deliver a powerful network effect]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ Since @VitalikButerin and @jcp wrote the original plasma paper a year ago, I've been thinking about how a team could create a large network of plasma chains]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[2/ Why is it then that Dash and EOS are derided as plutocracies, whereas Decred and Tezos are praised as inclusive communities?

I think the answer is small communities + strong self-selection and a complete lack of intra-community diversity (aka filter bubbles)]]></document>
