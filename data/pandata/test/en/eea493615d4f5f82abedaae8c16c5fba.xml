		<document><![CDATA[@surgical_SHO @EllenNewman93 its about placing the patient's preference at the centre not what the staff member feels comfortable doing - no one can object to their name but they can dislike what people call terms of endearment]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@PadraigMacA @Colmogorman Both.

		<document><![CDATA[@rhetorician @patriciascanl18 @Colmogorman that seems fair &amp; if it is truly person-centred care then that implies that the person should be asked.
