		<document><![CDATA[Per this tweet, is someone working on an abstraction layer on top of all lending services where I have a default (eg compound), and set some risk parameters and such for higher interest loans?

		<document><![CDATA[2/ So this got me thinking: if you host the content underlying a CMS on decentralized infrastructure, can you get the best of both worlds?

I think the answer is yes!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ If you read that post, there's a common thread among the challenges of decentralization that self-hosting Ghost users face: setting everything up by hand

Turns out, one of the greatest traits of centralized system is the ability to Oauth into all kinds of 3rd party services]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[0/ Since reading this excellent post from the Ghost blog platform, I've been thinking about if decentralized CMS makes any sense.

Because really, if you think about it, Ghost allows for decentralized CMS *today*

		<document><![CDATA[1/ I find the Lindy effect to be not very useful for making predictions. It's a nice story to describe historical phenomena, but there are too many exceptions to the rule for this to really work

		<document><![CDATA[8/ In summary, this situations makes it clear that social consensus does matter. Hash power alone does not make a chain successful

{fin}]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[7/ Instead, we're left with the status quo - a stalemate in which exchanges don't want to re-enable deposits or withdrawals for either asset. This is net bad for both chains as both chains are effectively unusable right now]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6/ If exchanges list SV, they create the potential for SV's price to go up. The higher SV's price, the more resources that SV miners have to attack ABC

Therefore exchanges have no interest in supporting this]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/ Given the outstanding threat against ABC, and that exchanges are the most at risk from block-org attacks, exchanges are very clearly not in support of SV]]></document>
