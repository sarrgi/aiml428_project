		<document><![CDATA[@cwgNAS @TerpWeather @mapgirl18 I do think it's that many of the people who have the free time to follow weather that close tend to live in NW or north and west in general. I get it sorta but it also feels a little like a pissing contest.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 yeah that's a good idea might have to look into it. I forget how old the station is. Arboretum is a good one too although the coops do 12-12z but should still be workable if they report enough. there are some other locations that are in theory better but seems move doubtful.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The fall line is fun. I know less than I should but @TerpWeather or @mapgirl18 might know more... it cuts thru DC. If you've spent much time in DC you know the NW part is very hilly and there is a general slope rise overall. 95 more or less follows it in most of this region. https://t.co/007UNkBTUu]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 snow measuring is just a bad thing overall.. it's always amusing how terribly people do considering it's such a simple concept. I guess in a lot of ways I just think of them in their buckets rather than specifics but that's because I look at numbers too much perhaps.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 it's def not targeted at you.. you just reminded. I actually wanted to write a post refuting the idea that moving to the WH would make much difference but think it ended up a little to niche or something. people have an odd focus on DCA tho-better than many cities climate loc.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Hard part now is getting proper totals because the older stuff has compacted. Partly why the pros use a snowboard (although I'm guessing very few of the public does).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Good news is DCA is going over 6” anyway. 1-2” per hour rates in the heavies here. https://t.co/3sEla1cilr]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I looked at like 40 condos when I was searching and I think 2 were east of the fall line because of this issue.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The Mall is near sea level to about 20 feet. White House maybe 30ish. Dupont Circle close to 100. If you're east of the fall line you don't have much elevation in general. DCA is rather representative of downtown.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Zoo reported 5.9 at 12:45 which was close to my 5.8 at 11a. American had 6 at 11:40a.  DCA 5.4 at 1p. 

DCA is at about 10-15 feet elevation. Zoo around 200 feet. American around 300 feet. Almost exactly how you'd expect the numbers to look on that alone.]]></document>
