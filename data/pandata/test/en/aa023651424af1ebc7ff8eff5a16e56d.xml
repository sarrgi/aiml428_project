		<document><![CDATA[Snow is nice and caked around here.. about 1" on everything but roads. Should be quite scenic in the morning. Reminds me a little of one of the forgotten snows of 09-10. ;) Or legitimately as big as anything 11-12 and 12-13.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@swalsh8771 I'm rather level headed and have significant policy background etc. I guess in some ways I figure if I'm freaking out others should too.. but there are ways to refine the freak outs I suppose.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @CommsDirector: This is true -- obviously, deeply true. And yet somehow people refuse to acknowledge and prepare. https://t.co/jTKZU5owIZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@brettjrob @stormhighway agreed and honestly these issues are one of a number of reasons I've become less of a photog in recent years. very few that don't do vid/imagery seem to get that lifting just one photo even with credit is like stealing a whole day in some cases. there does often seem no hope.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This guy is a very stable genius. https://t.co/YKJdmmWJpR]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ETTC19 also valid.. and perhaps they left for other reasons anyway. as averse as I am to worst case in weather forecasting I am not as much so politically... so perhaps the volume of that is undesirable. focusing rarely hurts.. I won't stop tweeting about this disaster.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@FunnelFiasco yes and in many ways I like this part more than the broadcasting.. although I do plenty of both. that said you can get lost in a conversation for hours if not careful. and there are always conversations to be had.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ETTC19 I'm definitely not apologizing for my opinions. My scorn has been highly directed and more people are getting grouped because they are staying silent or pretending it doesn't matter. Some can't differentiate... which sucks. I've seen allies drop tho so clearly I need to rethink.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@FunnelFiasco you know I'm not going anywhere. my goals are not that tough hah.. I tweet too much esp when I am bored.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Still torn on the connects I've lost from being political. I've lost enough quality ones I think it's worth a rethink in various ways. I am not partisan. I am quite knowledgeable given the field I was in. It's not all healthy tho--then again we are rather sick as a nation.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Working up a new sched to get back on track with book writing. It's hard to stay on track. If it works it will also mean significantly less tweeting.. which will be good for everyone involved I am sure. :p #fingerscrossed]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SirlinJohn dogs love snow! my feelings there are mainly because city at this point. if you're rural you can generally usually find some pristine stuff to look at etc.. not here. I amend to take in the scene.. after it just makes a mess everywhere and I track salt into my place nonstop.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @bri_sacks: I THOUGHT BUZZFEED JUST DID CAT VIDEOS https://t.co/a4pxyPdpHe]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ETTC19 it's a big mess no matter what. it's actually a bit shocking how terrible things have ended up. I cannot understand why the Senate is doing nothing at this point.. it is harder to think there is a non nefarious reason as they'd be hailed as reasonable by all sides.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fotodave well it's borderline either way there's not much sticking to roads here except if rates and only side streets. more that it's pretty hard to accumulate anything with light snow and a temp above freezing.. the 34 there and 32 here thing is frequent.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ETTC19 I'm not sure how much it matters in our world but I am still uncertain what happens after this is all done and we are no closer to seeing real collusion. he could be brought down on any number of other things at this point yes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The president is a lying criminal who has been conducting an information warfare (and now apparently economic warfare) campaign against his own citizenry. But there still seems to be a disconnect between wanting to collude and collusion.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[A reason DCA is often so low is that this is pretty common in the city. Above freezing downtown near or below in the hills. They had 0.1” at 7p.. about 3/4” here so far. https://t.co/w7tmLi4n6n]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[cc: @SenSchumer @iamcardib]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The real question is why aren't we looking into impeaching @senatemajldr? Trump is so amateur it's hard to hold him totally responsible. This guy is a pro and he is sabotaging the country like its his job.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You may notice that the gov is shut down except that the admin is trying to call all sorts of people back to work because holy shit this was a stupid idea.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @WeatherNut27: @islivingston Once it starts snowing its onto the next storm. 😜]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've seen Trumpites sharing memes about no one noticing the gov is shut down. Y'all being oblivious is a big part of the reason we got here, stop celebrating it.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@DaveSnider The title of that post about the gfs etc was unfortunate as I said at the time. It’s like when my neighbor tells me I should only look at the Euro because it nailed some storm. Idea that forecasts worse because a model might be and it’s only NWS impacted doesn’t make much sense.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There is no indication that government forecasts are any less good than they were before employees now working for no pay were thrust into a situation they had nothing to do with. The words we choose matter more today than ever. Correcting falsehoods is very hard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[During this lapse in logical leadership from the White House, it has been interesting to watch many large orgs self identify.

-Those which offer a can full of gas and a handful of matches in hopes of a buck]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's still kinda hard to see why Putin would see him as anything other than the #amateurhour he is. It's like he is a walking #amateurhour billboard. Granted the info war has been legit.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@joshtimlin I don’t think a nor’easter can put out the liquid a west coast atmospheric river can in general but it is cheating in some ways I suppose. Still way more real than LES. Not sure the ratios off the top of my head but they call it Sierra Cement for a reason.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 @NEWeatherRants Maybe people hoping to radically remake the country? It’s kinda the stupidest.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NEWeatherRants @rms5539 Ugh. These people. :/]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 It’s all a little too strange to not think there are no nefarious reasons. One thing for him to be a jackwad but they can go around him. This is far from MAGA.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Almost every time I see my dad I tell him one of his greatest mistakes was selling the condo in Mammoth. It's too far but still.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Derrick_Snyder I say that with full realization that if it eventually came down to it.. Trump and his allies would prob dump on the military just like anything else... but still.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Derrick_Snyder I guess the unfortunate part of a fairly well functioning gov is that it isn't that noticeable day to day. As someone who has studied and hung with mil leaders as much as most people you'll come across I am so sad how much more "revered" it is compared to civil service.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 sadly I've been freaking out for a reason. I do think it's partly they are clueless but now that they are seeing the results I don't doubt it fits their worldview to a degree.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@kschones84 that's the rational and loving answer. they are gross people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SimonStormRider they act like it's a television show... both sides do. it's very peculiar.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 Bleh sorry to hear. It’s just absurd how much the party is willing to run America into the ground over something so small in the grand scheme. And they pray on the misinformed base like leeches.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The shutdown impacts so few people... is one of the greatest lies this admin and its allies have spread. 

Huntsville is in Alabama for those Trumpites who think gov is only in DC. The trickle down disaster is only just beginning if this keeps going. https://t.co/UVYFkDzZRR]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stormchasernick It’s gonna be sad when I get banned for trolling the main account]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@wxdam If it had a short time limit it wouldn’t matter much. Most of the things I want to edit are like one typo and I end up deleting and not reposting half the time. It may be a way to cut down on bad tweets.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Indyweather24 It is odd they are so steadfast. I’m guessing it is that they are so much more embedded elsewhere etc they think people will change stuff later or  something]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TomMoorewx they do. it's pretty clear we need a whole new team in there for the most part.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wxmanms1 @Derrick_Snyder @EverythingWX yeah didn't know that. I guess I should have. but yeah there's part of our problem heh. at some point it will all become very apparent I suppose..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Kat_Cr @Wxmanms1 @Derrick_Snyder @EverythingWX that's interesting... and I have sort of suspected that based on comments that haven't quite gone there. again logic is not a strong suit. there's a reason there is a strong overlap between conspiracy theorists and these folks.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Kat_Cr @Derrick_Snyder @EverythingWX You'd think a guy who wants a space force might want to support the space industry. Logic is not a strong suit of Trumpism. It's hard to explain from an economical standpoint.. which seems directly tied to reelection odds. From the supposed genius of moneymaking.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wxmanms1 @Derrick_Snyder @EverythingWX I honestly did not know that.. not that I am the most up to date on America's internal runnings but I am not a low info voter. A lot of it has to be -- see everything now -- that all we do is complain when things are bad, and then ignore when things are good. Gov ignored b/c...!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wxmanms1 @Derrick_Snyder @EverythingWX even DC liberals will tell you the fed gov has tons of problems. it's an easy target... just not sure we've had leaders so outwardly hateful of our system before.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wxmanms1 @Derrick_Snyder @EverythingWX I have done it plenty but unfortunately when some folks call he who shall remain unnamed anti American he is actually just the worst of various Americanisms. He may not be a genius in everything but he understands hot button issues and the ignorance of much of the population.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Derrick_Snyder @EverythingWX also I'm not the right person to talk to lol. 

one plus is that we are finding all the holes and a lot of good people are rushing in. it's time to look into having this kind of thing not happening again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Derrick_Snyder @EverythingWX near the zoo I can tell crowds are down... the businesses across the street have to be hating life. it is winter but still. people vastly underestimate the long-term consequences.. I'm actually a little surprised we're still not cracking harder. must be coming.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EverythingWX @Derrick_Snyder It’s infuriating to people who get it. I wish we didn’t fail so hard on this aspect of what makes our country great historically. Something has to break at some point this is not sustainable. Sorry you all have to deal with this it is truly unfair.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Derrick_Snyder I've definitely acquired Trump is Deranged Syndrome.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Derrick_Snyder well people did say he didn't want to win. maybe he is trying to ensure he loses in 2020. if the economy isn't cruising he's in trouble unless we're in no election emergency or something. (which, well.. dear lord)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DCTrojan yeah I think a lot of it is #amateurhour but now everyone is dug in. still makes no sense but such is our country now.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@THE_Eric_Allen @rms5539 @NEWeatherRants my worry all along in this nightmare is that Americans are kinda soft. it sure seems like a general strike is needed but it's not even barely a murmur.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DCTrojan It’s just bonkers as a plan. It’s gonna thrash the leadership approval. I guess he is assuming he can bring down some Dems on the way but nonsensical.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[One thing Trump and pals don't seem to care about is calling everyone that doesn't agree with you the opposition is a good way to keep peeling additional percent off of approval.

He's basically taking the worst possible course on all ends at present if he wants to be reelected.]]></document>
