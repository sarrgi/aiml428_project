My response to both "Thank you guys, but steady on, I have not quite mastered multitasking yet x" 😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TraceyDontRock I am very pleased. Thank you x]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Waiting to go to a funeral. I am early. There is a whole load of people turning up for the funeral before. I feel it’s probably a young person sadly. I am finding this really hard today after mums funeral last year and the anniversary of my dad’s passing yesterday. 😕]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Whenever I come up north it rains. Ok, some will argue that Chesterfield is not north, but believe me, it feels like it the me. So is it pure coincidence or is it always grey ooop ‘ere?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@StephanieHirst Drinks with friends in Sheffield later. I think I brought the rain up by mistake. Oooops. Sorry.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Earlier this morning I passed a sign on the A1 (where they are doing the A14 intersection) saying “Delays expected until 2020”.  I remember chuckling to my self and thinking ‘well that’s no bloody good, I need to be where I need to be at 11 o’clock’ 🙃]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They say funerals are sad occasions and they are but when you meet some lovely people and see a picture of my mum and dad that I have never seen before it makes the day very special. Love this photo. X https://t.co/qmx9HYvn8c]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Northern_Goth Sending a mop and bucket your way. Bless you V x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@StephanieHirst Yeah, they are just as bad. Mind you had you of said red sauce I would have blocked you. 😉]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What’s going off in my world @StephanieHirst ? Well actually still struggling to open coffee sachets 😱 https://t.co/iUM8Db6BP2]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This decision is really affecting British workers, good people. The negative affect of #Brexit is already being felt in our roots 😕 https://t.co/zF2KnIbpbW]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Watching @BBCNews Apparently it's been ruled in court that @realDonaldTrump can't block people who abuse him or do not share his political beliefs. Whilst I do not share his beliefs or politics, I cannot help think that this is a dumb court ruling. Surely we have choice right?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alexalasvegas It’s a distraction for me. Can’t wait to get home.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SylvieHL Thank you for the update x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When you wake up to #KramerVsKramer and going back to sleep is not an option. This is why there is no telly in my bedroom at home!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In the Fox and Hounds in Denmead (no relation, it’s a village) with my friend Julie and there is a ukulele orchestra practicing in the back room. How rock and roll are we 🙃 https://t.co/KAm52EJdp4]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Red_Amber Not sure they were a wise move tbh. At night time they glow in the dark. Maybe confused as Landing lights on a runway 😱]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Lindsey_J0nes I “acquire” them from my hotel whilst away on business to use at work.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@piggyfeather Ha ha x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lisasevern @Naddy37 Well you need to go before. Can’t have a bucket list without a bucket. And I am working til I die. Cunning plan eh 🙃]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lisasevern Yep, done that too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Actually, no. Those bloody coffee sachets that can’t open. Grrrrrr....... https://t.co/qCAeI2lBOO]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[These little milk cartons are stupid. To understand if the milk is in date the lid says ‘see base’ and the base says ‘see tab’ the use by date is stamped on the underside of the tab which is almost I@possible to read unless you colour it in. Todays moan over. https://t.co/XURGhKEV4x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TraceyJustRocks I knew what you meant. The wonders of twitter and no edit capability 🙃]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TraceyJustRocks Gin darling. Can’t do wine. Too much sugar. X]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lisasevern yeah, i'll muddle through i hope.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My tight hamstring seems to seems to be more like a complete pull. Damn, damn and double damn.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think I am resigned to a disturbed sleep pattern now until I have moved. My head is all over the place. 😱]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Really pleased I clocked this on the treadmill but oh so disappointed that I actually planned 5km. If my hamstring didn’t tighten I would have done it, so I suppose it’s sort of ok. Maybe I can get back into 🏃‍♀️ https://t.co/rtcN4fMgES]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Andra_me_uk Hope you are ok soon Natalie 😕x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WonderKristine7 I am guessing so Kristine x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Saw my ex for the first time in 15 months. A lovely afternoon chatting away. Did not expect that to be honest but I guess the time was right for her. 🙂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Well a step change this week. 3lb gone, now 33lb in total and 11lb to go to the next celebration point. I hate this index so i don't know why i mention it but my BMI is now 0.6 away from no longer being "overweight".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Evening meal, catch up and holiday planning with @JooieJoo more affectionately known as the ‘hyphen’ https://t.co/5x2Yp26TGV]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Tired and disorientated this morning. Just tried to clean my teeth with my facial sun cream. #feelingstupid https://t.co/KVXYjaCHti]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stuarthollis01 @bbc5live Well we can agree to differ I think Stuart. 😉]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stuarthollis01 @bbc5live You are right. VAR in that instance did not help. Give it time. Over time they will tweak how it’s used and there will be less errors. Even now it’s getting more right than wrong I believe.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stuarthollis01 @bbc5live Root cause. Cheating by the Iran player imo. It all comes back to cheating. Until players and their management continue to condone this behaviour we will always have a problem.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stuarthollis01 @bbc5live And there is the paradigm. It’s not actually. Eg. If a player goes down in the box. He was clipped. But not enough to make him fall. Does he have the right to go down? My view is no. And every expert will disagree with me. So we introduce uncertainty right there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stuarthollis01 @bbc5live Give it time.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@realDonaldTrump Welcome to capitalism sweetie. You of all should know that. 😉]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bbc5live No. It’s a good thing. Teething problems for sure but a good thing non the less. What goes too far is the players and teams that try to influence (another way of saying cheat) the system. I want to see a paradigm shift in the attitude of players and the way we report cheating.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lisasevern No, it’s simpler than that. The weather this year is designed to be perfect until the day I move when i am reliably informed that it will ‘hack it down’ 😉]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jessicarose142 Oh I don’t  mind. It’s like an additional challenge when the studio is hot. No pain no gain as they say.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[By way of finishing up some odd drinks in the cupboard I am now sampling brandy and cream soda. D’you know, I think it has mileage xx]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TraceyJustRocks Haha. See, us lonely bitches rely on the wall clock 🙃]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This morning I packed my wall clock. D’you know, it feels like I have lost an arm.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KatyMontgomerie @helresa If it is just fear then that is personal to you an no one person can advise you, other than you. If it is whether you perceive you need it or not then the fact that you have doubts tells you all you need to know. Happy procrastination day lovely x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@StephanieHirst Love actually. Every Christmas since 2003. Without fail, makes me laugh, cry, cringe and leak happy and sad tears. X]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TransSamSurrey Exactly. She will pick it up over time. But I am sure your daughter will just need love and security. X]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Transsomething Went to a balance 4 business workshop today at my employer, who have been amazing. I gave a presentation on coming out in the workplace which was well received. One thing I did learn is that any minority group can feel excluded &amp; this is not just us in the trans community.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TransSamSurrey I would say to her that you are daddy and that you will always love her. Try not to complicate or educate. Just be a good parent. X]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MavenOfMayhem Bless you xx]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Lindsey_J0nes in itself, it I not. If you searched for the word "my" and replaced it with "our" it may be seen as more inclusive. #JustSaying]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I am fed up with the weekends. I make a list as long as my arm every week of things I need to do before I go back down south on the Monday only to repeat it all the next weekend.

		<document><![CDATA[Most of the time I am confident, focused, determined &amp; independent. Some of the time I feel emotionally weak &amp; not the rock that I feel or others perceive me to be. In these times I need a cuddle, not a virtual cuddle or hug but something real. Right now is one of those times. 😶]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@StephanieHirst There are so many cliches for this that are obvious and meaningful but, to be different, my advise would be “don’t mess up your mock exams. It just means you have to double take and your parents will give you hell. Made winter/spring ‘79 a living nightmare. 😱]]></document>
