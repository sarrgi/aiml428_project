		<document><![CDATA[@sonnyandluca @TatMum_Blog I negotiated a deal like this from Hyundai for my Mum and it was great - she had no time/energy to manage garage repairs etc. and we struck a finance deal where she could return the car and quit the agreement with no penalty if she felt out of her depth. &gt;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sonnyandluca @TatMum_Blog Ok this'll sound odd at first but I would consider a new car like a Skoda Citigo. Deposit of around £170 then finance at around £110 pcm.

Is this Brexit too, or what?!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Aibagawa Worth speaking to GP or a pharmacist in the know, huh? Potentially this could change things for a lot of people, I think.

		<document><![CDATA[@Aibagawa Nope. It’s a stress-related thing with me rather than a constant so I use it as a reminder I need to make changes to reduce the stress and, wherever possible, avoid negative stress and drama as if they’re the plague.]]></document>
