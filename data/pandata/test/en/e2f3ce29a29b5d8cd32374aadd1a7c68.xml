		<document><![CDATA[Don’t know what to make of the Lennon situation. If he is ill, I hope he gets better ASAP. Honestly, it reeks of massive shitbag and embarrassment to me though. Avoiding the players he criticised, the ones that gave everything since January. I’d be embarrassed an all 🇳🇬]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@joshcannon93 Sounds more like he’s thrown his toys out the pram after getting beat (rightly beaten). It’s a bit sad really, he blamed he players after they had been 13 games unbeaten and he changed the formation, it was his fault for the result.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@mckinnon410 Wasn’t great, but our lack of threat going forward was awful. It was a lot worse than previous games, games at Ibrox etc. Why change a formation that has been so successful with, a formation we have blown teams away with it. Flo and McLaren been great together. Mind boggling.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Unbeaten in 13 games until last night by playing two up top for the best part of it. Lennon changed that last night, bemused as to how that’s anyone’s fault but his own. He gambled, it failed, shoulder blame. Players have been superb since January, wrong to say anything less 💚]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@seathsmark @The_Tman10 You tell yourself whatever you need to believe the slaver coming out your mouth. Not won a Old Firm in like 11 games, lost the last one 5-0 and should have been way worse, 13 point gap in the league and no hope in the cups. Your fuckin deluded.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@seathsmark @The_Tman10 Celtic have been a lot worse than last season due to not needing to flex their muscles. Didn’t really get out of second gear and it’s a 13 point gap. If they spend (which they don’t need to) the gap will increase again. Either way you’ll no challenge for the title.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rmorrison1983 Hopefully he takes into context how much extra money he has compared to last season. Season ticket sales up as well, he’s managing a club on the up. Should be enough for him to want to stay. Time will tell. Personally delighted with the season. Fingers crossed for Europe 💚]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rmorrison1983 That’s all very well and good, but because they want to stay doesn’t mean we will get them. All put themselves in the shop window now and you have no idea who will go for them. Replacing McGinn and Dylan is the biggest problem. Possibly European tie in June. Not a lot of time.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[He’s not went about it the right way, but I can understand Lennon’s frustration about the squad for next season. McGeough away on a free, McGinn probably away on a cut price. Allan, Kamberi, McLaren and Barker all leave after loan spells. Be a very different team next season.]]></document>
