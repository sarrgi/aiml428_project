		<document><![CDATA[6/ By reducing the variance of payouts by 5x, a miner with .50% hash power can know with *much higher* probability that she's going to generate revenue every single.

Instead of less than 1 block / day, at 5x pace, she'd find on average 3.6 blocks / day]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/ Consider:

Reduce block time 5x, reduce block size 5x, reduce block reward 5x

This should not have a meaningful impact on computational requirements of miners or nodes

Yes, technically the orphan rate could increase, but even at a two minute block time, it should be marginal]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/ The simple answer of course is to simply reduce the variance of the system. This can be done *while preserving the current supply schedule*]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ At .5% hash power, you should find a block once every 200 blocks, or less than one per day.

While that might be manage on a cost of capital and risk basis (remember, there is wide variance), it's certainly not ideal]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ Because of Bitcoin's 10 min block time and and sheer volume of hash power, even a miner with .5% of the total hashpower is incentivized to join a pool

But this is not economically viable in practice]]></document>

One of the biggest problems in Bitcoin is mining pool concentration. Since pool operators control what goes into / out of a block, this is not good for long term censorship resistance]]></document>
