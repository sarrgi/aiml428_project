		<document><![CDATA[@jbeeson122 @nick_a_myers The Rock is trolling not sure what he wants in response. The commentary is totally unnecessary and "snowflake" has a direct political connotation. Pearl clutching.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ksrgatorfn how many huge bald meathead democrats call people snowflakes? I'm sure there are some. people make a lot of unnecessary commentary these days too. which is often a catalyst for more.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@BillyForney3 imagine there are a lot in the weather orbit overall. I like to think of it as a handy money saver as it can make a good weekend if I'm bored. ;)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@shawnmilrad don't follow a ton of chasers on my personal account... but again partly I don't go looking often. these places skew reality both ways -- some people that have obviously done the time and are legit still get misrepresented.. often thru self owns but alas.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@shawnmilrad chasing is one the whitest things possible. although tbh most chasers I've met are pretty chill and probably left of where they reside overall. but yes it is very white cisgender men and many of the hubs are in redville.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@wxdam I used to be more sympathetic than I am now oddly enough. Maybe because I am observing what is going on all around for one. In that I guess my distinction b/w Trump and his fans is less than it once way but I do generally try to maintain. I don't rail on R policy much...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BillyForney3 there is something fulfilling to seeing it. I am the oddball that can have endless fun with some databases.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BillyForney3 @kschones84 @Livestormchaser lol actually I looked and was thinking I feel bad. it was midnight last night... I do most of my edgiest tweets late when no one is paying attention ;p]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@crankywxguy it may be an invented theory but I believe the longer range megastorms on the models mean things when they show up. they used to be very common but they were killed off in improvements over the years so specifics aside it's a signal given the pattern IMO. plus fits progression.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@crankywxguy yeah something like that seems possible. honestly the pattern looks better for cold than snow... which would make sense in a frustrating winter heh. but it's still evolving and you need cold for snow.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@EdValleeWx I have minimal skill outside 4 or 5 weeks myself but it feels like most things are according to plan so far in these parts. Maybe not northeast of here etc. warmth was prob more sig than generally expected but that seems fairly common these days.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JessicaArnoldy @KathrynProciv I’m not sure they are as good at range as the name might suggest. Or perhaps they just jumped the gun a bit. Ensembles fully on board. Pattern should go till at least feb 10-15 before change/relax I’d guess. Possibly longer but early to say that.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ltgcg I'm sure it can be argued per some rules but the rules aren't followed on all products and it looks weird plus it is assuming a perfect forecast with no error in close. based on the rest of the philosophy there should be a watch.. but its a weekend I guess.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@afreedma bit = bite]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@afreedma I'm not sure how much it actually matters but it almost looks like they took a bit out of a straight line from E WV to MD bay area to begin with heh. WPC guidance is fairly high for 4+" to about DC. if you look at a map you might think eh nothing to think about.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[FWIW it seems likelyish to fall just short in the city at the moment but I don't know how anyone has that certainty given the model shifts still ongoing. I dunno if you need a watch all the way to Baltimore or N MD but to 66 or perhaps esp with snow starting in 24 hours.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Maybe it's to minimize the "it's not a downgrade" from a watch to an advisory... but there should be a watch up by now. It's just a watch.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@storm_paglia I haven’t looked yet and just left the computer heh. Sounds logical tho. The 6/18 seem jumpy compared to 12/0 but maybe imagination. It is pretty much right where we want it overall. 6 is doable for sure for you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I guess it's mainly the county boundaries but not sure why you wouldn't round north vs south in this situation.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HWPCWX not saying I expect snowiest winter on record but I think with how patterns lock up these days we could get into a hecs a week pattern for several weeks kinda thing.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@philliefan_99 these ones are kinda nice actually.. not a ton to worry about at this point. just wait for it to start snowing. if the grass blades are covered I'm good. should be easy enough here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@wx_virginia I'd guess they bump the watch to DC at least in the next update... maybe even farther given the Euro. then go warning in the late night package? we'll see.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@crankywxguy yes some of my q was that.. wpc has little discrimination between DC and south per their probabilities so I guess LWX might be on the low side to begin with. but still we tend to act like we know more than we do.. there should be a buffer on the edge IMO.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kebursaw we thank you for your sacrifice ;p]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@crankywxguy the thing with nino seasons is storms tend to look better in closing more than worse. at least around here. there was some risk with the strung outedness but it also seemed to be settling into a nice spot given the expected bumps.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Euro juiced up a bit. We are in "right where you want it" territory if you're a snow fan. Start talking ratios when the rest is increasingly certain. North of 10:1 seems a good bet. Half a foot into the city not impossible. https://t.co/lruakyxRf1]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ltgcg nitpicky but to me if you're buying a new philosophy you have to buy into it across spectrum. there are extremely relaxed "rules" on convective warnings and such. this is the first high impact event of the winter 24ish from start and this is the DC home page. almost tranquil. https://t.co/o6uTEBA7Aw]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Still doesn't make a ton of sense. I guess we're close in now but the better guidance suggests warning criteria is increasingly likely into the DC area. Watch for West Point where 2" (less than criteria) if forecast. Advisory here for higher forecast. https://t.co/NzLk8jg3f1]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@jimfryVOA NAM tends to be on the too wet side but we sit in a good spot to end up near the jackpot prob.. imagine it will still tend to the elevated areas north and west like usual tho.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jimmymarks it has a history of being the wettest model and that's prob the best run of the whole bunch so far. but the storm probably will trend north a bit still so we might jackpot on it I guess. or more likely just nw of here like usual heh.]]></document>
