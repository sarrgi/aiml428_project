		<document><![CDATA[@chairmandec @killianbyrne Compare the cards Leinster got to the one Murray &amp; ones Castres didn’t get. Munster stuttered to victory against 14/13. The media will hype it up but it was a false dawn from where I was watching. That fact will be lost in the next 48 hours and then columnists will call it out.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chairmandec @killianbyrne Stating he was a Leinster fan would have been spot on, not ex-prez of the olsc. You and I don’t wave our rugby credentials around as a means of claiming respect on social media]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@chairmandec @killianbyrne Yes. We did beat ourselves Dec. They were marginal and non-malicious disciplinary issues that wouldn’t have seen cards last season. Murray should have had one. At least Munster retaliated tonight unlike in Castres. Munster cannot be happy with their performance versus 14/13]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MaxDeegan Keep Learning &amp; Keep the Faith. Great Cameo today ⚔️]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@killianbyrne Your former OLSC role is irrelevant. Munster were poor given their numerical advantage for 75% of the game. Leinster indiscipline was the beginning, middle and end of the match. You couldn’t judge Munster’s performance other than by the margin of victory - intercept and all]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@killianbyrne What an exaggeration. We beat ourselves. Period. Your two best players were born and learnt their trade in Leinster. He HAD to win tonight. Back it up by qualifying for the PRO14 play-offs.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@threeredkings Totally hysteria from Munster fans here. Lowe was reckless and pulling out in a non-malicious incident. Furlong got Colete’s head accidentally with his chest in a clear-out. Murray scragged Larmour worse than anything Healy did. Grow up kids. Enjoy your win, such that it was.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@CiaranWest @eirSport @TommyBowe14 @lukefitz11 @Munsterrugby @leinsterrugby @PRO14Official Easily triggered aren’t you? To be clear. Munster were the better team on the night but commentators, like Donners on @eirSport (where this started), need to get  some perspective on what that match was. 15 v 14/13 and struggled to own the game despite that. Do YOU do get that?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@CiaranWest @eirSport @TommyBowe14 @lukefitz11 @Munsterrugby @leinsterrugby @PRO14Official Clever boyo. Murray should have been off for worse tackle than Healy. You still struggled to beat 14 but for a late intercept off a 20 year old. Munster are world beaters after that. Is that 2 wins in 12? Happy Christmas 🎄]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@eirSport @TommyBowe14 @lukefitz11 Lads, lads, lads…some perspective please 15 man @Munsterrugby beat 14 man @leinsterrugby on the back of some marginal non-malicious plays.

		<document><![CDATA[@oisoftheclears @BHHooker @SamCane7 Not slow. But not as fast as he should be. Great in every other way. Pocock very limited in attack. SOB better. Leavy best rugby IQ along with dirty Sam Cane]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PhdMurphy @threeredkings POM has 1 big game in 5 &amp; is a defensive player. SOB, Leavy, VDF, Beirne have better attack &amp; are more consistent. POM is unreal at lineout]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DonnellyStephen @HIVIreland Who are the 2 old guys at the table?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BHHooker @oisoftheclears Regrettably that is not possible with his shortage of pace. He has everything else. He runs on his heels, needs to work with an athletics coach to try and get another metre. @SamCane7 is the best World 7 IMHO but he is a dirty bugger especially in the tackle]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@OvalDigest Yep. Not alone in that. Another mucker of mine who played to a high level said the same thing. You haven’t told me why you thought their attack was slick]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@threeredkings So why is POM (who was red hot today) a guaranteed starter if all are fit (Tadhg, SOB &amp; Ruddock)? Lineout? If you or I were passed the ball as much as CJ is we would also be top passers - he is a bottleneck. If he develops footwork &amp; sleight of hand I would reconsider my view]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Murray_Kinsella @threeredkings Anyone prepared to give him an Honorary Doctorate based on previous incidents of misdiagnosis?…didn’t think so]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@threeredkings But he needs to be “James Ryan” consistent with those performances because his lack of carrying threat and overall ballast means he can’t command a place. Neither can Stander due to lack of distribution nous. No backrower is nailed on for RWC IMHO…which is good…to a degree]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@OvalDigest Couldn’t be any worse than last week. I am talking about our attack. No creativity from our Centre plays. Ringrose being used mainly as a battering ram.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@OvalDigest Yes, but I want to see Farrell too.  His two appearances in 6N were eye opening. Farrell &amp; Ringrose? Aki #4 for me]]></document>
