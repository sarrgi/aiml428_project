		<document><![CDATA[@HWPCWX @jhatem yeah but i'm not sure you're right.. the data comes from 12z it's not fully processed until later.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jhatem @HWPCWX got me. I thought SV was as fast as they come. it's starting now there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HWPCWX I think some is their prescribed update times... they aren't right after the main models.. so in these cases they are almost forced to lag, which isn't always the worst thing around here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HWPCWX should have waited with my tweet ;p]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@megachris a lot of it is the beginning of upslope (orographic lift), there's a reason n md and the blue ridge region are favored in that sense... but it does also tend to matter where the storm is to a degree.. can see it on the coast.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@antmasiello yeah I'd have guessed but haven't looked too close yet. in this case I think there will be some overlap between that band and the best from the rest... somewhere near me for one maybe hah.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @antmasiello: @islivingston That early morning stuff has better lift in the DGZ throughout the area.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Last 4 runs of the at least somewhat more realistic hi rez NAM. Maybe too wet but everything is trending wetter into the end and the Euro is pretty close. As said yesterday... right where we wanted it. https://t.co/67R5SwfR03]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DTVaWeatherman numbers sure but spatially it's prob not terrible .. the nam is always too wet now it's more reasonably too wet but stuff has also been trending up so 1 in liquid isn't impossible locally.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I do continue to believe there is a reasonable chance we'll be near the out of elevation jackpot which is fun.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The NAM exists partly to keep us from throwing the GFS in the trash. Run to run changes are significant heh. 18z is a bit closer to consensus now tho, although 10 in DC might be hopeful. https://t.co/82ZvDaQjda]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@greggadren Hah this area loves to oversalt]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @greggadren: @islivingston I just was driving home and I think conditions can best be described as "blowing and drifting salt".]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[One of many reasons you should support our government. It's actually pretty cool. And way better than the alternative.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ForecasterEnten There are legitimate reasons to not like it but it doesn’t seem everyone is dismissing it outright]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[People like to say winter storm naming isn’t catching on but the evidence seems to say otherwise. Maybe slow... since most of the originating industry refuses to play you might expect that. https://t.co/iOV15MmGZd]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Red_Head_Ed Yeah should be a nice snow no mixing worries etc. light winds too comparatively. Hopefully wet enough to start for general plastering then superband fluffies hah. ;)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@storm_paglia I waffled a bit with some bumps but happy with progression. In ninos just have to trust some ideas sometimes. North trend is also like 90 percent of storms. But ninos juice.]]></document>

Other times... not as much.

		<document><![CDATA[@mattlanza @LuchsLikeRain I don't know much about her I suppose.. I used to stay away from US politics whenever possible before Trump (I wish I could still). tbh tho the more I learn the more normal she seems compared to word on Cons Street. Much less radical than many in House on R side for instance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KansanRose00 it doesn't make any sense.. other than he hates gov and is trying to destroy it? illogical that everyone is wandering around humming to themselves.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[RT @capitalweather: Saturday's digit: 5/10: If you're a snow lover like me, any day with accumulation is a 10. Maybe some think it’s a zero…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I feel like it was just a few days ago Brit Hume called me a racist for pointing out that people might live paycheck to paycheck and he has no clue. I guess he thought they were about to get paid? lol governance.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@steveginx definitely more logical than sexist and racist (toward white guys that is).  it's complicated but I have had growing annoyance with older folks lately.. it does often feel like they just don't care since they don't have long left.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've remained too stubborn on this issue I suppose. Especially since most things with Trump are worse than expected. It's just hard to fathom how we've gone so long without more coming out... these folks are imbeciles.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@philliefan_99 not too atypical.. some of the best stuff seems to be pre-storm if you can time it right. same with tropical systems and usually sunset given where they are coming from.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @philliefan_99: @islivingston I got a cool red sky and sun pillar the morning of the January 2016 blizzard, so it's possible.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LuchsLikeRain yep. it is interesting how the whole system is being redefined in some ways relatively quickly.. not sure it's all or mostly good, but it is something. I'd call myself more pro establishment than most but at this point I'm willing to burn most of it down.]]></document>

it's true. https://t.co/nQaNkO23Vz]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@epicciuto we need this]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@wolfpackwx hadn't heard. congrats! I already feel less tired now myself.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[New NAM more or less held, minor shifts not worth too much thought. If the Euro holds I'd think winter storm warnings still get into DC. Seems fairly likely the max from the storm will try for our area. Elevation has best chance but could be immediate area. https://t.co/LyNMTfISOi]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Pre-storm sunrise is often a winner. Can still see the moon out there tonight. Looks like a chance in the region tomorrow. Enjoy, early birds. ;) https://t.co/ECf9OHIztv]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[18z = moar ☃️❄️🌨️ https://t.co/bnyP7nDOzP]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GolferChris68 I have considered this too, and would probably tend to agree. sometimes you make decisions you don't like to get things moving plus it's likely only a small part of what would be needed. it seems that we've traveled down just about the worst road so far.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MetropolisGal yep thanks!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jstreb1021 Yep]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Apparently part of #MAGA is returning us to the great days before flight. https://t.co/evPqhKaM5b]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jstreb1021 no it's not far from where it could start having much bigger repercussions. we may even see some solution pretty fast now but it's still all very weird and I wouldn't bet on it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@djpressman they have to know the wave is still building... but the speed of institutions bending and such has been disconcerting, plus the supreme court could be on its way to uber conservative. dems need a decade of fervor.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[RT @Edoteque: @islivingston I’d be curious to know if and how much this would impact the GDP if it drags out for a month or so.]]></document>
