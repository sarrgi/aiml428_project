		<document><![CDATA[@kevinhall9 @williamhboney1 I don't believe that they have a mental illness, they are usually in hospital for an acute infection i.e a UTI or pneumonia they are mistreated mainly because they are old &amp; sometimes because they have dementia which is a neurodegenerative brain disease]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HousemaidFear @kevinhall9 @williamhboney1 They are medicated to stop them walking and asking to go home - Nurses are allowed give serious anti-psychotics PRN i.e. which is often for a non-medical reason - many of these meds are contra-indicated in dementia &amp; still they give them - it's inhuman]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kevinhall9 @williamhboney1 technically if they could get out of the ward they could but many are frail &amp; need supports at home to recover
they are vulnerable and if they say they want to go home or try to leave they are sedated or given anti-psychotic medication the equivalent of a chemical straight jacket]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kevinhall9 @williamhboney1 Nope they are often kept in locked wards and hospitals seek orders from the courts to retain them. Frequently they are not even consulted, medics and families make the decisions It is a violation of human rights - appalling]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Niamhie101 @williamhboney1 1/2. indeed but many people, not just old people, are kept in them because we don't have proper service For e.g. if you sustain a brain injury in a car crash you can be kept in an acute hospital while you wait for a bed in the national rehabilitation hospital]]></document>
