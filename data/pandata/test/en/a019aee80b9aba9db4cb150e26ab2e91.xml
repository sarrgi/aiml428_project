		<document><![CDATA[@lukefitz11 @CianTracey1 I am enjoying tnx but there are a lot of pods out there so 2 thoughts for improvement.

I thought your insights on Joe the Selector &amp; &gt;&gt;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lukefitz11 @CianTracey1 OK. Let’s ignore the significantly superior stats &amp; agree that it was a game of skinny margins which the Aussies deserved to win (they executed &amp; were creative…we didn’t and weren’t).  Was our pack demolished? Yes or No?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CianTracey1 @lukefitz11 It is a game of opinions &amp; facts. Nobody else has said or will agree with you on the pack having been “demolished”. 61% and the rest says that is just wrong. Can’t dodge that. Appreciate the replies.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CianTracey1 @lukefitz11 The result is what matters but those stats are much closer to the truth of what happened than stating the pack were demolished. 61% possession, superior line breaks, metres, line-out, rucks…everything bar 1 scrum. They created &amp; executed better in a few places. That’s it IMHO]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@CianTracey1 @lukefitz11 That I can better understand but you said the pack “were getting demolished…” - that doesn’t tally with 60% even allowing for the breakdown. We beat them in EVERY stat bar the scoreboard (which we lost in last 20) with 8 turnovers each]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@lukefitz11 @CianTracey1 Good Pod lads. Cian referencing how well Joey did considering the Irish pack were smashed was off the mark. There were some physical hits but we won 60% possession (&amp; territory) in both halves. You don’t do that if you are being breasted by the other 8]]></document>
