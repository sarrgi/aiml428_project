		<document><![CDATA[@wxjay @judah47 @MJVentrice well I wasn't trying to put a timeline on it and yes it has been around a while.. but the study still is in its early stages compared to many other parts of the industry. it does sorta feel it's become more concrete over the past decade even but maybe a misconception.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've decided not to look at models anymore for this storm because why... but radar looks pretty nice. See if this band can set up somewhere. https://t.co/8FVQA801Kq]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stormchasernick we thank them for their sacrifice but it's worked at this point so let's move on]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DanielJohnsonWx it's not a bad run overall. tho should figure out how much of the total is the light precip that goes on forever]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Should learn to wait for the high rez.. not bad, and actually wetter than 12z west. Pretty small moves at this point. It did tighten up the gradient to the north. Bumps at this point. You'll notice I didn't mention the GFS tonight because #lolgfs. #nameurorule https://t.co/EnI63Kbm0z]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Red_Head_Ed we also overfocus on qpf when it's not the best variable when it comes to skill on a model. some of the changes we see at this range are error as much as anything. the northern edge seems locked in place tho heh. still got 2 more suites.. or 3 I guess.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Drier than 18z but not the worst. Raising numbers late generally seems to be met with a set of runs that throws some caution to the wind.  

One interesting aspect is the DC area might get in on the typical banding on NW edge that can pump totals past model numbers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@storm_paglia altho still pretty solid it seems]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@storm_paglia it's gonna be not as good. like I said earlier in the week.. wait till morning. ;p]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@storm_paglia this has to be your fault]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Me: I'm not going to watch the 0z Euro run for the second time this week.

Me 30 seconds later: Hello there Euro hr 24.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wxmanms1 @JoeTheWXMan17 @mattlanza @rboyle31 as far as I can tell many of these past events were also well forecast. I know Jan 2011 here was.. as was the NYC area superband. again there are prob a few diff types of snarling events but these seem a bit specific to intensity.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rboyle31 @JoeTheWXMan17 @mattlanza @Wxmanms1 I've taken a bit of an interest in these as well. I've been tempted to become a traffic nerd before. Anthony Downs was one of those people I read before I ended up in DC.. can be fascinating stuff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JoeTheWXMan17 @mattlanza @Wxmanms1 @rboyle31 yeah I dunno. I think there are other cases like the light accum or trace of ice causing things to go haywire which might have easier solutions in some ways. there's just no way around crazy rates piling up while cars sit on a road then plows cant get through.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wxmanms1 @mattlanza @rboyle31 I might be underthinking it but it seems to me a great solution when it's absolutely ripping is to not have tons of cars on the road. I do imagine many would not necessarily heed a shelter in place warning... so cancel the whole day? What if it busts etc. Maybe it's just a thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JoeTheWXMan17 @mattlanza @Wxmanms1 @rboyle31 they seem to follow similar patterns.. at least the massive meltdowns. happened here in Jan 2011.. feds let our early.. into what became ripping thundersleet then went to heavy snow and people were stuck into the next morning. NYC in Nov was similar too. https://t.co/KUXNRggFO7]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rboyle31 @Wxmanms1 bad driving will always happen in bad weather but at a certain point snow rates are just too much. if you send a ton of people out into them a massive traffic jam of stuck people has to be one of the most likely outcomes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mattlanza @Wxmanms1 @rboyle31 even with no cars 1-2"/hr rates are almost impossible to keep up with esp at the higher end. shelter in place might seem extreme but possible it would be like 3 hours while the worst moved through instead of 12 stuck on a road next to a bunch of unhappy folks.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wxmanms1 @rboyle31 yeah it seems sorta similar to other instances here, nyc, elsewhere. I am not sure it can be solved by good forecasts. almost like people should shelter in place (no leaving where they are) until the roads are cleared in those instances.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HWPCWX and it's still going heh]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@USWeatherExpert @ltgcg at least at times I should say.. not sure it's always. I think certain regimes (nina) the GFS has done better in.. maybe because it fits its bias better? I dunno.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@USWeatherExpert @ltgcg it's oversimplified here and I'll prob keep looking at both but I really do believe it makes forecasts worse or less certain at the least. in this storm here if we didn't factor it in things would look less confusing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Bscott4293 heh watching it. maybe it's right. ;p]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@H2Omaker71 could def be the best stretch since then]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 it's happening. heh.  would expect some sort of banded area to better than modeling consensus but seems overdone as far as coverage etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MrTinDC ha we can hope]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @MrTinDC: @islivingston No more washed-out weekends, please. That was 2018 - 2019 is the year of sunny weekends!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Euro (and GFS) have potential next weekend but storms forming on fronts are almost always tricky. Early guess is 12z Euro from yesterday will not be happening. ;)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't think this is right ... to be clear. The Hi rez 6z NAM here. #nice https://t.co/MH3dUbvGlK]]></document>

Gotta be overdone but this should be a fun one. #rightwherrewewantit https://t.co/HvKMLd9Wtq]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@steveginx I don’t really hate all old people but I don’t get why we aren’t allowed to be disgusted looking at things. Sometimes it does feel like old folks in Congress are setting stuff on fire on their way out.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[RT @MDwx4cast: @islivingston Yeah, it’s an all time NAM run given what the current expectations are. It also predicted 20” in Oklahoma in D…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TamBouret lol. I don’t have the best words.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@scm1133 Lots for this one and maybe.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@wxdoctor Around here it’s more that it’s always an outlier esp with winter storms. There are a few cases it’s not.. which are usually well publicized heh.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I am wondering if it’s just overdoing extent of banding. DC area is in a pretty good spot for that. I would expect the jackpot to try to be closer than usual. https://t.co/U00fbk7ZpE]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[NAM has a long and storied history of being too wet but this is about as crazy a solution as I can remember compared to expectations in this range. There was a duration question all along... still, wild.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This has crossed my mind this morning but the main NAM is still pretty hard to believe. The best storms trend up to gametime usually and we do have that it seems. https://t.co/KYENjuMe8g]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrHietanen Haha thought that might be it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @DrHietanen: @islivingston Hot take: I’ve come to like you more for your political posts than weather ones. 😬]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@steveginx Might be the best NAMing ever]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @steveginx: @islivingston lol WTH https://t.co/ZoNwxJPb45]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The 12z nam snowmap is seriously NSFW. Like 6z its higher rez version is less wild but still impressive.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jsaysitall I hadn't looked too closely lately... 0z eps seems on a similar track but slower? there's def a signal there but not sure - have been assuming the weekend after is the bigger threat but who knows.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just given how much it is spitting out (plus its history) these runs seem overdone. That said, the Euro has been juicing and it's typical of Nino winter systems overall. Some bands seem likely to score some bigger than currently shown on non automated maps totals. https://t.co/lbEUQNG4Qn]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Another mega NAM run just out. Duration a wildcard for a while then we got lost in details. Now it's back in the mix as we are near the likely jackpot zone? 

One thing I've beat the drum on this year is all the great upper level setups. This one is "stringy" but otherwise ideal. https://t.co/bEL9p2FKGL]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stormchasernick never been good at naps... prune juice however]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @stormchasernick: @islivingston Make sure you schedule a nap after your prune juice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also double the coffee intake. Two (big) cups! I remember when I used to go into a snowstorm not totally exhausted.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ForecasterEnten The analogs can still be helpful maybe ... it’s not all things but on East Coat snow it’s consistently 🤮]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've largely disregarded the GFS in my personal thoughts on this storm and I'm pretty sure they were better off for it.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@wall_cloud @P_E_Saunders @toweringCU The biggest problem here might be how the right’s narrative is the one most of the country believes. We’ve apparently done a terrible job of highly valuing civil service and good governance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MJVentrice I’ve definitely been skeptical in the past but it does seem that knowledge is quickly increasing. As mentioned to @judah47 in some tweet convo with others it is a bit like being a pioneer. Gonna be bumpy.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MJVentrice It is pretty silly 🙃 .. good stuff here I barely get it myself but I’ve learned the positives of ensembleizing smart folks lol.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @MJVentrice: @islivingston Love it when folks say, "Oh way to take a stand on cold weather and snow during the climatological peak". 🙄]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@BTWCelticShow lol was fun]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Usually the north and west crew cashes in more than expected because banding sets up and lives there. A good bit is terrain influence but we are sorta in that region with this storm otherwise.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The band the HRRR is focusing on near the Potomac (VA/MD border region) locally could rip for some spots this evening I'd guess. Might be in/near the region the highest storm totals end up. https://t.co/yQz8ZhSU15]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_jwall it's a pretty fun pattern to get heading into peak snow climo. I wonder how much it might shut down if cold overwhelms but my guess is it won't overwhelm in the way it used to with a similar look. next month or so could be wild one way or another.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MahalikWx lol]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@passportdude I won't lie about texting some wx buddies that I hoped BOS gets flurries. I did knock on wood after tho. ;) oddly enough our best storms tend to miss Boston entirely or mostly. I guess it makes some intuitive sense. The perfect coastal climber is relatively rare.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@crankywxguy @stormchasernick say I don't forecast numbers but I do tend to do so in replies somewhere. this one wasn't all that hard.. although I'd bump a bit now. someone locally seems likely to near or enter double digits I'd think. banding/moating issues but could be worse. https://t.co/F4MMuF9Se4]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@splillo All the yuge cips analogs running thru my head hah.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @splillo: That's a pretty substantial and consequential trend in the last 24 hours (in the GFS too) for a 36-hr forecast. https://t.co/4…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @rms5539: Decent lift in the demilitarized zone overnight and tomorrow morning. Might do quite well considering ratios https://t.co/GxfV…]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@HWPCWX second wave .. week 2ish ... more your classic mega HECS window as the deep winter is dropping in (and perhaps shutting down the pattern for a time)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HWPCWX I've liked this window more.. they are about once a week tho and in prime climo they all can do damage.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HWPCWX the euro yesterday was insane tho so saying it's not going to happen isn't saying a lot. the setup isn't bad it's just not easy historically. I don't necessarily believe in atmospheric memory but we've got the tracks this winter so far ... now we also have cold to play with.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @capitalweather: Recent data suggests a "boom" with our 3-6 inch (4-7 inch south) snowfall forecast is possible. May update our snowfall…]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[RT @capitalweather: 2:05 p.m: Bumping totals UP again. Expecting a Category 3 or “significant winter storm.” Widespread challenging travel…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@John10Hoeve honestly never look too hard but I think no reason to stray hard from climo per this map @wxmvpete posted. if anything maybe lean higher given it is peak cold and the storm is pretty far south. bigger snows tend to settle more too though so a factor maybe. https://t.co/7CImvGAo3r]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[HRRR loses some utility at range like most models but continues to highlight banding this evening. We could be talking a good 2-4" of snow or so without much trouble from this by around midnight if on to something. https://t.co/vIXXitWaRZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mapgirl18 I'd bet you end up in the warning in the end but #overthink for some reason]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wxmanms1 yeah although tbh our big events tend to have a lot of spitty snow to end.. maybe an inch or a few of powder on top type of deal. still it could keep us from widespread 10"+ or something. someone could get 12-15ish in banding tho maybe... not far from here perhaps. we'll see.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One q is the dragged out nature... this run has snow continuing all day Sunday and 0.1"+ liquid (1"+ snow) after sunset tomorrow. I dunno how well it all accumulates but snow does tend to stick to snow if it's more than spitting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[New Euro quite a bit wetter than 0z and increased from 6z. If anything it looks a bit light on the front end and models are notorious at missing heavier banding as well. Pretty reasonable to think double digit totals in the city are possible even if the lower rez NAM is iffy. https://t.co/2AyKSrVODV]]></document>
