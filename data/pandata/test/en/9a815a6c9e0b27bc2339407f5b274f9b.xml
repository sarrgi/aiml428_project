		<document><![CDATA[@JRD0000 @Jimcorrsays @JohnJKelly20 Bear in mind some sex differences in the brain run along a continuum where males and females can fall at any point but the average differs between the sexes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JRD0000 @Jimcorrsays @JohnJKelly20 I’m just trying to understand where your ‘fact’ regarding your choice of the term gender for biological differences rather than sex comes from? Especially as you disregard dictionary &amp; authority.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JRD0000 @Jimcorrsays @JohnJKelly20 I’m a neuroscientist. The brain is plastic &amp; constantly changing it is dynamic influenced by experience environment genetics &amp; evolution. Curious to know where you studied human sexuality &amp; neuroscience?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JRD0000 @JohnJKelly20 @Jimcorrsays Why the need to warn? I’m not conflating it is a common mistake to conflate gender and sex. We need more education. Gender, sex and orientation are 3 distinct things.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JRD0000 @Jimcorrsays @JohnJKelly20 So the dictionary is wrong? Where does your definition that gender is biological come from? It’s not my chosen field of expertise but I did study human sexuality at university. Either way biological sex characteristics have multiple variations.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JRD0000 @Jimcorrsays @JohnJKelly20 You are mixing up gender &amp; sex. A simple look at a dictionary will confirm that. https://t.co/SyU2pffB8t]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Jimcorrsays @JohnJKelly20 You are mixing up gender &amp; sex. Gender is culturally constructed. Sex is biological There are more than 2 sexes. There are many variations in sex characteristics for eg chromosomes xx, xy, xxx, xxy &amp; xyy Also in gonads genitals &amp; sex hormones]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Niamh_NicGhabh A no is always hard. Universities don't take account of the time spent applying for funding. It is easier for those with permanent positions to get more publications which is 'accounted' because they don't have to write funding proposals. some do but they don't have to]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Niamh_NicGhabh This is such an important post. I don't think that many people are aware that researchers have to write proposals for funding so that they can work. For many getting a no is more than a disappointment no funding means, no salary &amp; no job]]></document>

However the Alzheimer society asked for money in this budget for community supports and none was forthcoming there are areas around the country with zero supports]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BDuffyBrennan @McguckinAnnette @jimdalytd @alzheimersocirl @ALONE_IRELAND @AgeAction @activeirl @Age_Opp @AgeFriendlyIrl Choice is key. I fear that older people will be forced out of their homes through property taxes or 'empty' bedroom taxes to make room for young families. Addressing our housing problems cannot be a zero sum game where one group of society gets shafted to accommodate another]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@McguckinAnnette @jimdalytd @alzheimersocirl @ALONE_IRELAND @AgeAction @activeirl @Age_Opp @AgeFriendlyIrl I call it Age Apartheid. We need to be promote intergenerational engagement not put up barriers to it. Also there is an inherent presumption at all older people are the same so lets lump them all together. It's ageist]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@McguckinAnnette @jimdalytd @alzheimersocirl @ALONE_IRELAND @AgeAction @activeirl @Age_Opp @AgeFriendlyIrl In the UK they've forced older people out of their homes by introducing a vacant bedroom tax - people in their 70's &amp; 80's can't afford the tax and are forced to move miles away where they no no-one. It is an appalling way to treat people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@McguckinAnnette @jimdalytd @alzheimersocirl @ALONE_IRELAND @AgeAction @activeirl @Age_Opp @AgeFriendlyIrl absolutely - it again puts the care/home/service provider at the centre not the person - sticking everyone in one place makes life easier for them but denies the rights of the individual who wants to remain in their own home. This mustn't go ahead.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@dementiaireland @KieranWalshMPSI @susmitchellSBP @CareAllianceIrl I don't believe it should be segregated at all
