		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed Good point although I'm actually referring to the post-2007 period when Paddy ushered in what is a golden era of major wins!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed Many of the Euros won their first majors while playing in Europe. Westy's game &amp; marriage left him after moving Stateside!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed Sergio is fun n bubbly &amp; has changed + has got game so I figure he'll win a couple. Westy a better person now, so let's see!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed He's putting it behind him still I think. Not quite there. Hard work this winter and I think we'll see Westy contending...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed I'd love to see more ensemble majors like The Open 2015; lots of big guns, oldies and a talented amateur or two duke it out!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed hahaha. Maybe we'll end up liking TWD. Now he's a Major champ there'll be more interviews &amp; hell contend in future.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed In my view Sergio's as good as Spieth &amp; Day. Scar tissue is why he hasn't achieved. If he wins one soon, more will follow.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed So true! In future I think we'd both love to see Rory vs Glue, with a side dish of Day.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed ...At least a real no name (Streb, McGirt) didn't win it! I'd like to see a Euro Johnny-come-lately like Donaldson win one!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Great Top 10s @Paul_Casey @thatton91. Hope you guys push on &amp; challenge for the big prizes in@2017. If #JimmyWalker can do it, so can you 👍🏽]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I want to know why #Yanks are always the lucky ones? Why don't Sergio/Westy/Casey/Luke/Poults/Monty/Jiménez/Bjørn have that luck? #USPGA]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[See what I mean? That putt was missing all the way and yet somehow it curved in. How lucky can you get? #JimmyWalker #USPGA #PGAChamp]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#JimmyWalker is lucky. Lucky draw, lucky breaks, holed bunker shot, long putts, tired Stenson, unwell Day. The list goes on #PGAChamp #USPGA]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They're making it too easy for #JimmyWalker. They just haven't applied much pressure at any time. When they got close, they didn't push.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed True although Rory has done it many times when it counts. 4-time Major Champion. The others frustrate me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Will #JimmyWalker's luck run out down the stretch? #USPGA #PGAChamp]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@suarez7_legend Hah yeah he looks tired. This weather &amp; draw has played into Walker's hands like a dream. He's got lucky yet has made putts.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This #USPGA is frustrating. Jimmy Walker has shown signs of vulnerability but the world's best haven't applied any pressure 😬 #PGAChamp]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@suarez7_legend We did. He really coughed up that hole. Thought he'd go for this but he's clearly shattered after the last two weeks!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed He's been solid but lucky too. Why the hell can't Sergio, Westy, Casey, Luke, Poults, Monty, Jiménez, Bjørn etc do this?! 🙄]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed Dear old #HidekiMaysuyama is as bad at putting as Westy, Casey etc; just can't hole any! Bless 😊 #USPGA #bbcgolf #PGAChamp]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed There's still time...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed @ShamoonHafez hahaha. They're bored into submission by Jimmy Walker. What a dull person &amp; player, lucky bunker shots apart 🙄]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed He will I'm pretty sure. The others aren't exactly making him work hard for it tho are they? I thought they'd go after him!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed So at least TWD is a decent player. Hopefully he proves us wrong &amp; contends many times in future (tho without winning 😉)...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@suarez7_legend Hoping he can pull it off down the stretch. It's time right now...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed Definitely! I just don't see Walker as a major champion. He's not even contended. Surely nerves'll do him down the stretch 😉]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed Thoughts? #USPGA]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed Actually based on the last three holes TWD looks rather nervous. He won't get away with this tomorrow and Sunday...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MackerOnTheMed hahaha. At least Fatrick is likely to be a top level player for years. TWD is a journeyman who's near the end of his career!]]></document>
