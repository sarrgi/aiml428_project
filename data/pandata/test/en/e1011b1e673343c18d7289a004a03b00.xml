		<document><![CDATA[@EmerWhyte @JCforTeachers That is the ideal but the reality is different. When teachers get a Principal sitting down asking them how many Distinctions, Higher Merits etc their class got, and then asking them how they will improve on those numbers, things change.
This is a shame but it's the reality.]]></document>

I'm not attacking any teacher seconded to @JCforTeachers. I know many of you and I know you all to be professionals dedicated to the betterment of student learning and, indeed, teacher learning.

		<document><![CDATA[The reality, on the ground, in the classroom, is that if you put all of these elements together, add in pressure from parents and Principals pushing you to ensure your students achieve a high grade, then something will give.

		<document><![CDATA[Emer. You are correct in saying that these two LOs are directing us to teach writing but neither of them states how long that writing must be. Indeed they both ask us to teach the impossible. How can I complete such vague outcomes? https://t.co/HX1NCkl0dQ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We were told that the reason the HL English exam is only one paper, completed over just 2 hrs, was because they wouldn't ask for any long answers

		<document><![CDATA[@Claireissimo Absolutely.
We are encouraged to do essay writing (and many of us do) it's just that as it's not part of the test, it is an element of their portfo, corrected by the teacher, many teachers don't give 'full' essays. Exam pressure still reigns supreme.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@LiamDGuilfoyle @TaralyonG @JCforTeachers Of course some tasks aren't suitable. 
But this task is suitable for all ages, and is seen as suitable for all ages but was removed from state examined assessments. Now it is up to the teacher to decide whether they will get their Ss to write essays. 1/2]]></document>

But I do see them as implementing others' ideas. And not all the new JC specifications are as messy as the English one.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is just...I mean...I can't even...
Let me try:
'We changed the JC so that students never have to write an essay. The LC demands that they write an essay. Something will have to change'
Maybe make sure they HAVE to write an essay at JC?
What are the chances that will happen? https://t.co/CEd5W6h7zx]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MissGEng2015 @NCCAie That's the problem with any possible change. If you have the money you'll try to buy your children their results. Any change to the LC that doesn't take inti account this reality will simply widen the gap between those with and those without.

		<document><![CDATA[@MissGEng2015 @NCCAie Our concerns were voiced. During the review stage our concerns were voiced again.

		<document><![CDATA[Now think about what will happen with continuous assessment.
Will it be liberate the students? Will the students be able to fully explore their learning?
