in the brisk and shallow restlessness
of early spring
I think of her,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[two strangers
who were,
it soon appeared,
not men at all,
but gods.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh, to love what is lovely, and will not last!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When this book ends
I will pull it inside-out like a sock
and throw it back in the library.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarred—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Whoever named the place learned the hard lesson,
I'd guess, without much fanfare or delay.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[we keep ourselves alive,
if we can, taking one after another
the necessary bodies of others, the many
crushed red flowers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and for every person
the body glowing inside the clothes
like a light.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it needs the body's world,
instinct
and imagination
and the dark hug of time,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and to do this
I will go indoors to my desk --
I will sit in my chair --
I will look back
into the lost morning]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall
back to the sea.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[while everywhere I look on the scratchy hillsides
shadows seem to grow shoulders.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[but still they asked for nothing
but the difficult life
which they had already.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No doubt he thought of everything
that had happened in his difficult life.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Every year
the lilies
are so perfect]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I will look back
into the lost morning
in which I am moving, now,
like a swimmer,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'd watch the face, how the mouth
has to work, and see any strain, any
sign of what lifted the voice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and every pond,
no matter what its
name is, is
nameless now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We hope for magic; mystery endures.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[all day I think of her —
her white teeth,
her wordlessness,
her perfect love.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[All summations have a beginning, all effect has a
story, all kindness begins with the sown seed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Where, in what country, might I put down these thoughts,
Who still am citizen of this fallen city?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think of this every morning
as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Every morning
the world
is created.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it is also this dazzling darkness
coming
down the mountain,
breathing and tasting;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[An echo,
continuous from the title onward, hums
behind me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I wake earlier, now that the birds have come
And sing in the unfailing trees.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Because, properly
attended to, delight, as well as havoc, is suggestion.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[whatever it was I said
I would be doing—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[to be more than pure light
that burns
where no one is --]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thought buds toward radiance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I wake earlier, now that the birds have come
And sing in the unfailing trees.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And for all, I'd know more -- the earth
bracing itself and soaring,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Around him, the villagers gathered
and stretched forward to listen.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A candleflame in Tibet leans when I move.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall
back to the sea.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I thought the earth remembered me,
she took me back so tenderly,
arranging her dark skirts, her pockets
full of lichens and seeds.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[to love what is mortal;
to hold it
against your bones knowing
your own life depends on it;
and, when the time comes to let it go,
to let it go.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[All summations have a beginning, all effect has a
story, all kindness begins with the sown seed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh, to love what is lovely, and will not last!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If I stopped and thought, maybe
the world
can’t be saved,
the pain
was unbearable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and listen better to the wind
or to the air being still.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[For myself, I find my wanting life
Implores no novelty and no disguise of distance;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You aren’t much, I said
one day to my reflection
in a green pond,
and grinned.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and I want
to live my life all over again, to begin again,
to be utterly
wild.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thought buds toward radiance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh, to love what is lovely, and will not last!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Today is a day like any other: twenty-four hours, a
little sunshine, a little rain.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One fall day I heard
above me, and above the sting of the wind, a sound
I did not know, and my look shot upward;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'd watch the face, how the mouth
has to work, and see any strain, any
sign of what lifted the voice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here or nowhere I will make peace with the fact.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If it is your nature
to be happy
you will swim away along the soft trails
for hours, your imagination
alighting everywhere.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[By now the hawk has flown five miles
at least,
dazzling whoever else has happened
to look up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think of the blueberry fields, the blackberry tangles,
the cranberry bogs.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[How long do they live, fluttering
in and out of the shadows?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think of this every morning
as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[whatever it was I said
I would be doing—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And did you see it, finally, just under the clouds --]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[All night
in the brisk and shallow restlessness
of early spring
I think of her,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is dark in here, but the chapters open
their beautiful spaces and give a rustling sound,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[like the rain pelting the trees, like a waterfall
nifing down the black ledges?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and after a while it rises and becomes a creature
like her, but much smaller.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Slowly, beneath the branches,
he raised his head.
He looked into the faces of that frightened crowd.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The first fish
I ever caught
would not lie down
quiet in the pail
but flailed and sucked
at the burning
amazement of the air]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[As for spiders, how the dew hangs in their webs
even if they say nothing, or seem to say nothing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Surely
a beast might be clever, be lucky, move quietly
through the woods for years, learning to stay away
from roads and houses.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[edged
with pine boughs and wet boulders,
pawprints of bobcat and bear,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The ants bore into the peony bud and there is a dark
pinprick well of sweetness.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A candleflame in Tibet leans when I move.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[the air
finding every leaf and feather over
forest and water]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[On a cot by an open window
I lie like land used up, while spring unfolds.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[until the white snow is written upon
in large, exuberant letters,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A perfect commotion of silk and linen as it leaned
into the bondage of its wings;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Surely
a beast might be clever, be lucky, move quietly
through the woods for years, learning to stay away
from roads and houses.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It offers me its busyness. It does not believe
that I do not want it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[the hard knife-edged love
for the warm river of the I, beyond all else;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The smell
is lurid and flows out in the most
unabashed way,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[when they rose
out of their mortal bodies,
like a million particles of water
from a fountain,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[attracting
into itself a continual spattering
of protein.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh, I could not have said it better
myself.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[as we glide
Over the final jutting mountainside,
Across the suburbs tangled in their lights,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[a white cross Streaming across the sky, its feet
like black leaves, its wings like the stretching light of the river?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and, being the color of snow, catching the sun
so they were, in part at least, golden.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[all the dreams of my blood
and all outrageous divisions of time
seem ready to leave,
to slide out of me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it was
a flock of snow geese, winging it
faster than the ones we usually see,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No doubt he thought of everything
that had happened in his difficult life.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and to do this
I will go indoors to my desk --
I will sit in my chair --
I will look back
into the lost morning]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[while everywhere I look on the scratchy hillsides
shadows seem to grow shoulders.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and the old couple,
shaken with understanding,
bowed down—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It doesn't have to be
the blue iris, it could be
weeds in a vacant lot, or a few
small stones;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[As for spiders, how the dew hangs in their webs
even if they say nothing, or seem to say nothing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Under the orange
sticks of the sun
the heaped
ashes of the night
turn into leaves again
and fasten themselves to the high branches --]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[so it enters us --
in the morning
shines from brute comfort
like a stitch of lightning;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Slowly, beneath the branches,
he raised his head.
He looked into the faces of that frightened crowd.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[while all around me the lilies
are breaking open again
from the black cave
of the night.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When anyone talked to me, whether
blame or praise or just passing time,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[to love what is mortal;
to hold it
against your bones knowing
your own life depends on it;
and, when the time comes to let it go,
to let it go.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Which is the only way to love, isn't it?
This isn't a playground, this is
earth, our heaven, for a while.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[that it is more than the sum
of each flawed blossom rising and fading.]]></document>
