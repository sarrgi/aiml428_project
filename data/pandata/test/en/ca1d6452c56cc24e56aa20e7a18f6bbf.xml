		<document><![CDATA[6/ Perhaps COs are the right model for true Dapps... build the incentivization//viral factor in from the ground up

Of course, that still doesn't answer the question - what P2P cannot be served by web2, but can by web3?

https://t.co/AGjNz1KiKh]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/ Of course, the answer is that the CO version of the app will be better than the private version, and that the viral-coefficient in the commons-version can be much higher

It's plausible this is the right view. However, given the empirical data we have, color me skeptical]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/ So let's say you're the founder that develops the insight for the next major commons-type app. Why would you build it as a CO rather than as a private company, and generate all of the wealth for yourself?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ Social media services are the quintessential example in all commons-type applications for obvious reasons

And it turns out, they work pretty well in the web2 stack

As a result of that, the founders/investors generated unfathomable wealth]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ The model presented in the post is really interesting. For a product that a) is a commons of sorts, and b) achieves product market fit, I find that the model makes a ton of sense, except in one really important way

		<document><![CDATA[@radicalvin @wheatpond I leave my CC at a bar and they could steal a lot of money from me that way

Purely transactional relationship

Already tons of trust is out there, and the status quo works]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisamccoy @jaygoldberg People grossly misunderstand the source of CC fees. Micro payments don't really solve those problems without getting rid of basic consumer protections]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lrettig @DennisonBertram I don't see how micro payments solve this problem.

From a tech perspective, micro payments means streaming payments in real time (e.g. $,01 / second). If you are paying high factoring fees, telling your customers to pay you $.01 / second for some service is unlikely to happen]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JainArgh @NickSzabo4 yes I concur with Szabo. But my point is even stronger - even for M2M use cases, micro payments don't matter because you can use trust + batching instead]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[7/ Micropayments really do sound like a compelling idea. As tech nerds, we're use to thinking about streaming packets of data for all kinds of applications. It's natural to want to turn that into streaming packets of value as well

But this is already a solved problem, via trust]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6/ This is why I'm skeptical that micropayments will be seriously adopted

		<document><![CDATA[5/ Given the marginal cost of most digital services is near $0, this is totally fine

Or in other words, the cost of trust is actually quite low on sellers, and is a net positive for buyers (less friction)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/ If we zoom into a smaller setting, we can see that everything above holds true.

For most subscriptions (cell phone, AWS, etc), the subscription is post-paid. So if I don't pay, they just cut me off in the future, and they eat the loss for the past.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ Most traditional businesses do payment on net 30 style terms (I think this is a left over from shipping days), often for charges that go into the 6 or even 7 figures.

So basically, all large $ commerce is based on huge amounts of trust]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ There are two fundamental repercussions here: impact on cash flows, and trust.

The smaller the total $ amount, the less it matters that the seller is paid immediately after purchase, because total plausible downside is very small]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ Let's say I make widgets, and you buy widgets.

You purchase 10 trucks full of widgets. 2 scenarios:

a) trucks arrive every 30 minutes
b) one truck arrives per day
