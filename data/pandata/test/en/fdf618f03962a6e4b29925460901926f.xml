		<document><![CDATA[So, when we talk about rote learning, about students not thinking for themselves, when we talk about changing the LC, maybe we should talk about alternative ways to get into college.
The points race dominates.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Why?
Because the Leaving Cert leads to college places.
This is a huge issue. Get it wrong for the students and they don't get into college.
That's all we want, to get it right for the students.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We, parents and teachers and thus students, are worried about THE EXAM, the Leaving Cert. This dominates and we don't want to make a mistake and ruin the students' chances of success.
So we fall back on what has been 'right' before and make them learn that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Again this is partly down to moving from 15 to 18, not wanting to put their head above the parapet.
But we, as teachers, have to look to see how we have contributed to this. And so do parents.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Simply growing up counts for a lot here. They have been, carefully, shown that maybe their answer wasn't the right one, that they can be wrong.
But somewhere they start to be afraid to write down their own thoughts and ideas.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I was a bit taken aback and sent off a tweet defending students.
But she has a point.
Ss in 2nd year KNOW that they are right but by the time they get to 5th year they want soemone else to GIVE them the right answer. What changes?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yesterday I posted about how I try to get senior students to come to terms with there being no single 'right' answer in English, that there are multiple possibilities
@LouiseCrowley2 answered commenting that this kind of independent thinking is rare from 2nd level Ss at 3rd level]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Mr_PHuff @INOTEnews I do that regularly at Junior level and even a bit at Senior level. It's not about the quality of the image, or even the completion of the image, but more about the struggle to picture it, to create form from words.

		<document><![CDATA[@LouiseCrowley2 I'm isolated in my classroom so can't comment on how prepared they are in general but I do know many students that are more than capable of arguing their point, as well as a few that just want 'the answer' + these are often the most argumentative.
'Sir, just give me the essay!']]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You know when people talk about the sequels that went against the trend of being crap (Godfather 2, Empikre Strikes Back, How to Train Your Dragon 2) they should also include Gremlins 2.

C is how well you explain and stick to your answer. 
L is how well you write your answer.

I realise each one is a bit more subtle than that but this might be a good starting point.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is a shame. Season 2 of #IronFist was really enjoyable, simple fun with great character arcs. And the ending made me excited for an 80s style season 3 romp.

		<document><![CDATA[The key to English is that you bring your own experiences to the text, you see a word or a line and see something others may not. It's the combination of the intellectual and the emotional (or experiential). Senior students find this difficult at first.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Reading #HowTheWorldThinks and came across this line. One of the problems facde in LC Eng is students looking for 'the right answer'.
