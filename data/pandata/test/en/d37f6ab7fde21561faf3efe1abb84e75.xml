* It snowed for 35 straight hours at Reagan National - 10.3" fell!!!
* Was top 10…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Vaphilly624 it was good but this was much better here. dynamics were way better than. people that live north and west might underestimate how many storms suck entirely or drift toward suck after starting well. that one was a sea of slush and drips downtown and melting as soon as it ended.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_WxPhil_ yeah I remember being out in it.. and I think nonsubjectively it does rank higher but this is a bit subjective. these are the top 5 for accum at DCA in my time here either way. today reminded me a bit of St Patrick's 2014 but I forget my final total would have to look.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pazzo83 @DTVaWeatherman @wall_cloud There is some argument that if you name stuff then what happens with the small unnamed thing that is terrible to some locale. Or like th  Joaquin case where it aided the pattern block up that caused SC floods but it wasn’t Joaquin. Rational is a bit flimsy tho imo.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_WxPhil_ Maybe mainly I don’t like wind that much. Dynamically it was more interesting... results I’d take this one. But it was a crazy snowpack.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_WxPhil_ @DTVaWeatherman @wall_cloud it's true the research doesn't back up all the claims but there is also limited research. it's hard to see how it's doing damage.. calling one storm 35 different things seems worse. there are a lot of heavy biases in the field.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Was thinking how this storm ranks on my 13 year DC snow list... I think it's the following. Dates and DCA numbers shown. 

Feb 5-6 2010 (17.8)
Dec 18-19 2009 (16.4)
Jan 22-23 2016 (17.8)
Jan 12-13 2019 (10.2)
Feb 9-10 2010 (10.8)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DTVaWeatherman @wall_cloud already enough people making stuff up here DT

1) lol

2) it's in use other places and who cares it still makes it easier long term to refer to storms etc. it is intuitive.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @kiltedvet: @islivingston 9.8” via a metal measuring tape dropped into accumulated snow on an elevated &amp; wide porch railing in a low win…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mpierceva yeah it drops us like 30 degrees in 5 hours heh. cold should be legit.. hopefully the warming for the storm after is wrong.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@storm_paglia was a good one! hard to say for sure I suppose. eventually the bulk of the trough passes a nice spot but we've already wasted most of the storm by then. could change if it's not handling the northern stream right I suppose as it helps drag the thing north.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[10.2 doesn't change the ranking, fwiw. Next is 10.5 on 1/28/1928.. top is 28, 1/27-28/1922 (Knickerbocker)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JimFryVA Yeah I took a fairly straightforward path but it seems a bit needle in haystack like at the moment]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @MGagi7: Everyone kept saying someone would get a foot out of this storm. Leave it up to Clarksburg to come through! Just under 12” and…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@skosanovich @mattross72 this might be the best source these days altho the dca update isn't there.. maybe that was inside knowledge heh https://t.co/VAjnhcc5wy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kennygartner maybe a little. this seems kinda heavy on the northern side to overcome but it is a bit early and this last one didn't look amazing at range.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Bscott4293 guess it can't be ruled out but there's so much warm flow out ahead of it gonna need some shifts.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The next sys still looks quite hard to do right. We rarely do well when that's the case. The main upper lobe eventually passes in a nice spot but this is after warmth is dragged in along the front etc. Frontal systems are mucho tricky in this area. Potential does not mean snow.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@stormchas4 @EricBlake12 err "steady" as in it wasn't throwing off random blobs of mega precip like the regular NAM. to be the lower rez NAM just goes haywire over some things. I wondered and tweeted at the time if it was just indicating higher potential and placing too many bands everywhere or something]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stormchas4 @EricBlake12 yeah agree or people just use all models the same and blend them or something. there seems to be a lot of lacking nuance even among pros tbh. the hi rez was actually rather steady and also fairly rapidly increasing in precip through the end. n trend happens like 75% of the time.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@EricBlake12 Yes. The north trend is real, especially in El Nino.. and the juicing is also a Nino trait. But we screw stuff up so much here and the Dec storm was probably in minds... never as easy as it looks as you know.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EricBlake12 numbers were lowish locally until 24-36 out then kept going up. I had to look up my jackpot mentions.. these are in the days prior to the event. my n/w call was a good one maybe hah. https://t.co/TY1ljYYCGu]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EricBlake12 well it certainly 'boomed' I guess I just think the signs were there.. which I could find tweets to prove but I tweet too much lol. I try not to mention numbers much here for a few reasons... I am an iffy snow forecaster storm to storm and I go with CWG's forecast over mine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Crist_Cacewx yeah that may be true.. not around here though. I'm pretty imby in winter ;p]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DildineWTOP not too familiar with it to be honest. It does come up in March most years hah.. similar lingering of the ull.. more potent initially https://t.co/BicMZPU7FL]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[12z Euro went the wrong way prob. In general it has been moving that way. A possible out is if the northern stream isn't what is modeled and the southern stream takes over completely.. which isn't crazy in a year like this maybe. But it needs some work.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidPriess @capitalweather I think this is the closest we've come to jackpotting since I've been here. maybe some tiny storm.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@willkomaromi lighter events tend to be more photogenic here as well prob partly because of the wind aspect. i don't like wind for snow photography much. plus i lived on a hilltop in CT with no trees so I remember seeing bare ground after every storm hah.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@SStirling I’m usually ready for a good twitter throw down ;)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mhajjar78 Truth be told I am fine with snow melting after it falls but it also matters on the front end. One reason DCA looked like everywhere else. Even in lulls yesterday it was enough to help keep roads wet that weren’t covered. Do tend to get more snow with higher sun angle here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@wolfpackwx We’ve never been great at snowpack but definitely noticeable if you can get dec-Jan snow vs feb and beyond.]]></document>

May explain why they think government is bad even though it is the foundation of all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@markellinwood In more ways than one probably! The other social mediaism is updating the forecast too frequently.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jhomenuk A lot of times it’s two sides of the same coin but yes we generally fit into roles over time that are fairly consistent it seems. I do think you can keep it from biasing the call but it is hard. Also people unwilling to let go of old ideas etc etc.]]></document>
