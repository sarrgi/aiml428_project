		<document><![CDATA[@HobanPat @ronandusty Definitely buy it!!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ronandusty Yeah, enjoyed that one too. I think my problem with this one is that I know a bit about the time whereas I knew very little about the historical background to The Searchers.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MrAbe101 I can see why they are moving the date, so we can stagger all of these CBAs etc, but to do so a week before the original deadline is ridiculous. The bloody thing is hard enough to explain to parents and students and now this.

		<document><![CDATA[@ronandusty @NiallXMurphy @Scannain_com @Film4 I have a system that goes by genre and is chronological, yet includes grouping by director and takes into account country of origin and language. But it also by taste.
So Ford comes first and his section ends as the Westerns begin. Kurosawa next, obviously.
Simple really.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@FDHarrington I agree. But there is a problem. Motivation. Without the motivation of the points system, of the need to do well to move on to 3rd level, where does the motivation come from? This is an issue at JC with the CBAs already.
