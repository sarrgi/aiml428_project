		<document><![CDATA[@chrls_t1 @anxietyqueen84 @amandabarrie11 I'm happy to agree to disagree. I think we had a good discussion.

		<document><![CDATA[@chrls_t1 @anxietyqueen84 @amandabarrie11 Yes, it doesn't matter how long ago she voted as long as she maintains those views now. Everyone in there has some sort of agenda.

		<document><![CDATA[@chrls_t1 @anxietyqueen84 @amandabarrie11 It's clear he wants to keep public attention focused on it, which is a good thing considering the rise in homophobic rheroric Europe has seen recently.

		<document><![CDATA[@chrls_t1 @anxietyqueen84 @amandabarrie11 I have to disagree. As a member of the LGBTQ community, Shane knows how important it is to inform wider society about the difficulties faced by queer people. Ann's votes against marriage equality continued a long history of marginalising queer people and he's right to bring it up]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@anxietyqueen84 @amandabarrie11 I think that's a nice sentiment, but I don't think anyone should ignore a person's actions in the past when forming an opinion of them.
