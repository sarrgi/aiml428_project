		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 I enjoyed Redemption. But you don't cover it on the site?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 I'd rather see canvases that were unhappy. Which can lead to future Redemption episodes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 I know it's ridiculous. Sometimes like Sausage won that but still lost the finale.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 After last night's lack of organization I expect a disaster of a finale. Don't care who wins just want something organized.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 It also sucks for the open canvases who technically donated their body for nothing. Yes a free tattoo but still.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 Actually Matt's was shown right after he got eliminated because of a tattoo he did earlier in the day. We never saw Kelly's unless online.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@mattobaugh @dangergirl101 I don't blame you. Work smart not hard is my mentality.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 3 finalists to do a certain style. Then after she got eliminated nobody saw her master canvas (who was also pissed off on social media)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 Depressed about the fan outrage. He eliminated Kelly because "they've seen her do this style before" even though fans voted for all]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 Last finale Dave Navarro disappeared off social media for a few days cuz he was depressed. I listened to him talk about it on Dark Matter]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 Yes, common sense always takes a vacation that day.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 Finale judging is a whole other show that we expect to be a disaster as always.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 Not denying that. They made It sound that they would get judged by 2nd tattoo and Black Cobra with their first. #inkmaster]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dangergirl101 this episode made no sense. Basically Black Cobra Tattoo got a day to relax for not getting picked #inkmaster]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sad to see @TommyHelmArt  and Empire State Tattoo get eliminated but I'm still rooting for Old Town Ink. #inkmaster]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[WTF? So basically Black Cobra Tattoo got a day to relax??? #InkMaster]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Why would Golden Skull Tattoo or even the Alien Mary people want to be picked? They could have easily won #InkMaster]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That's not right. Giving them only 4 canvases and if not picked you are up for elimination. #InkMaster]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ha! Matt and Katie screwed themselves by recommending every artist and they ended up getting stuck with the worst canvas #InkMaster]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Is that @WWETheBigShow or King Kong Bundy??? #RAW]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars That's why I think it's all Raven and not her mom.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars Yeah but with Raven, if her mom is responsible for this then she'd be over protective and not let her on the show.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars Wow I didn't realize there was a real thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars But I was wrong about hypochondria. Its actually the fear of getting these illness. Not the fact that they think they have it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars I think something may have happened and she over exaggerated the disorders but to the point where she may believe it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars I've seen the list of things. Hypochondria is an illness where a person thinks they have every single illness they hear about.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars I think Raven just has hypochondria. But Alex is just a bitch.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars I actually like Raven over Alex.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars He'll be gone soon though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars To be fair this house has a lot of horrible people. Only Cody and Kevin were genuinely good. Same with Mark.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars She's pretty much a glorified furniture in the house. Anyone can easily beat her in final 2.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pamelammars Too bad she'll be a final 2.]]></document>
