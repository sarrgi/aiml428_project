		<document><![CDATA[@AshleyBastock42 Congratulations on NY! It’s fantastic, of course. My friends keep saying they want to see Hamilton but don’t know how to get tickets, so I keep finding some and going with them. But this year has been insane. NY three times, Vegas once, and 3 coming up in Durham.  Very 🍀 lucky!]]></document>
