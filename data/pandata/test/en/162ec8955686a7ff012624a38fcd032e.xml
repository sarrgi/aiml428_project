		<document><![CDATA[@drdhanlon @keelinodonoghue @campaignforleo @SimonHarrisTD We cannot rush in an unsafe service just because women are able to access abortion pills On-line. A bad service or indeed a good service will not stop this completely anyway.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@PriscillaLynch @IvanYatesNT Happier now that ICGP and ICOG seem to be more accurately representing members concerns and fears. We all want a quality service asap rather than a rapidly delivered one with serious flaws. All Docs and Nurses want the best for our patients.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@freesafelegal @ivanabacik @Lawyers4Choice We don't want any unnecessary delay but we need to get it right. A world class service should be the aspiration.

		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne I can provide high quality service in things I am trained and qualified to do. I can also refer people for services that can be done better by others.

		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne Ensuring a service is safe is not scaremongering. We have a history of starting services with inadequate supports and resources. Not sure why you want GPs to do something majority dont think they are qualified to do. And no one is refusing to help women in crisis.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne Utter bollocks, making simplistic comments like that shows a complete lack of both emphathy and understanding. Safe and quality service is better than a poor one delivered by everyone.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@susannormaokee1 @Doctors4Choice They should either have USS on site or have rapid access it, they should either be able to do an curettage onsite or have rapid access to it and they should ideally be able to do LARC insertion and STI screening.]]></document>
