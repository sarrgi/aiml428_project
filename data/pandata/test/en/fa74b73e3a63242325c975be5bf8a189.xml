		<document><![CDATA[I have a theory that we could beat 09-10 with like 6 HECS in a row thanks to #jetweirding. Probably not this winter... or maybe not.. but someday before it only rains in winter.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kevinsweather @bpm_dcwx yeah.. it's a smaller area but some has already fallen too. but the dc number doesn't match the color as you can see.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bpm_dcwx and my zone is 5-9 or 6-10 depending on how you add it up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bpm_dcwx their earlier map that had 8-12 for dc was weird because the colors were like high 7/borderline 8]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is a really interesting pattern we are just starting. Cold may eventually overwhelm it following the storm after next weekend's storm. But... it prob has potential unlike any I've seen here other than the infamous late Jan-early Feb 2010 stretch.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ulmwxr Hah true. A lot of the best storms you play with the dry slot too. People also forget it can take 18-24 hours for 8 inches to fall.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[This is a storm DCA shouldn't be way lower than other spots. Starts around sunset.. temp quickly below freezing. The worst place to be is downtown on a street somewhere.]]></document>

I have however been on that second storm ahead period for a while so I'll stay with it I suppose. next week seems hard but we also nail ULLs this year left and right.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@wxmeddler It was decently cold.. Jan not so much but Feb was rather cold. I think -5ish or so. But we did sorta end winter after the second one then march onward was torch.  

This cold looks more impressive than typical so it could certainly overwhelm the pattern. Juicy tho.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @DistrictWino: @islivingston @waclark4 @capitalweather Currently in Cathedral Heights about 2 3/4 inches https://t.co/EFID4dRBZe]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@waclark4 @capitalweather tbh I chose my place based partly on snow. there's a notable difference with the fall line and even going up the hill to the cathedral (partly why I did early) there is usually more snow.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fotodave interesting as it's set to perform and then some.. and then maybe and then some. I dunno if it's just extra moisture in the atmosphere these days or what but next level.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[This worked out pretty well. Model blends are good for you. HRRR heavy through half the run then some hi rez nam/euro blend or something. If the HRRR makes sense at least. "Overproduced" expectations otherwise I suppose. https://t.co/CzIO78eGV3]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@hbwx hah yea. wind is picking up a bit too finally.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Does look like the bullseye so far is near DC and along 66. Models shifted north into the end so even the last forecasts were prob a little to south. https://t.co/cFfdC0Brg1]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Gonna wander at least into the edge of Rock Creek Park in a bit. Not too common you get such a windless snow.. although it's falling due to its own weight at this point.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@DCsmom51 yes I'd expect at least 8ish here at this rate and looking at radar.. which puts a foot+ in play perhaps.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Red_Head_Ed yeah I'd suspect I have at least 8 and maybe 10+ by the time I wake up (since it won't be super early at this rate).. 8 hours or so from now. radar looks better every time I check.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DCsmom51 it has been steadily looking more impressive. snow is too slow for twitter speed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Red_Head_Ed it's crazy how many super memorable events we've had in recent years. this might be the best late trend since I've been here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DistrictWino @waclark4 @capitalweather yes not a big low so less windy than usual. I was hoping to get out early but I am always up too late....]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Red_Head_Ed Maybe even more radar looks pretty good.  I almost made a tweet about all the sad mornings. I have a feeling it will be a little surprising looking for many.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Looks like the wet roads giving way more now. Not sure it has totally stopped snowing since it started.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Pretty good.. prob as banding dependent as anything. DCA can look like other locations when it's actually cold. (although it's not that cold) https://t.co/wNxzTzLNgq]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@mapgirl18 @mattross72 actually thought radar looked better than what I woke up to but no complaints hah.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@publichistory @mattross72 that's prob fine. technically you're supposed to use a snowboard and clear it every 6 hours but I just measure a bunch of spots and take avg basically. as long as it's not grass or something as that adds depth. trashcan tops, car tops, elevated wood etc are good.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Time for some #snowwalk. https://t.co/VAo7nnVBux]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Near American U checked in with 6 inches. First in DC 6+ on the map, although I know @mattross72 has recorded a bit past that downtown and the near zoo measurement was earlier. Nice thing about these maps is you can zoom to an area then sort by max snow. https://t.co/VAjnhcc5wy https://t.co/WJsyx6KoCh]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[A storm like this followed the ideas of those who have been around a while but there is still very little move past what modeling shows in any forecast. I guess they're so good it can be folly not to listen but it does still feel a little too huggy at times.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 Many do hah. I’m just not sure it’s a one to one comparison on measurements much of the time. The public tends to pad totals a bit imo. A lot of times it’s also like 33 there and 31 in the hills. I did do a ratio once there vs here should update it]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 This topic makes me tweak sorry. It’s way more representative of downtown than many stations for their city imo. We just have a lot of hills etc. maybe a smidge low who knows. I also measured at like 11a after compaction]]></document>
