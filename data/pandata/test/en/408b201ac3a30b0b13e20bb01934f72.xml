		<document><![CDATA[@GraceMcGettigan its appalling that @pressec shared an edited version of the video and that they revoked his pass. I think all Whitehouse staff should return their press passes in #solidarity with @Acosta

		<document><![CDATA[@cathalodonnell @MichRogCook I'm always wary of commenting about such cases when I'm not in possession of the full facts or was not present in court.

		<document><![CDATA[@conor_pope I've had similar incidences of outright rudeness and even aggression on my doorstep from'representatives' of both companies &amp; a charity. I complained in one case not sure it achieved anything but it's surreal to be abused at your own front door for asking legitimate questions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roisiningle Implying that wearing a thong with a lace front is something that is relevant in a rape case is not a client's instruction
it's propagating a damaging &amp; dangerous rhetoric that suggests that a woman's underwear is somehow a sign of consent. It's regressive &amp; frankly disgusts me.]]></document>

I agree that playing &amp; reading together are better
I wasn't suggesting one instead of the other
But kids get homework &amp; so setting good habits &amp; preferably making it enjoyable should set them up for the future at school]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@deshocks 1. One other thing that jumped out at me was the advice not to prioritise doing homework because the child is only 5. I disagree, build good habits from the outset, otherwise you are setting up future problems Tts an opportunity to have time together make it enjoyable not a chore]]></document>
