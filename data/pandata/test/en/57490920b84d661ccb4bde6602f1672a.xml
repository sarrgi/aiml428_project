Would like to have seen more on Ipswich's near title misses, and the failure to qualify for Euro '84, and the claim that he was the greatest English manager ever, when you consider the claims of Clough and Paisley was bold. &gt;]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[9) It's a difficult one. I just feel, 'You feeling better?' doesn't really cover a heart attack. It's a big thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[8) My concern here though is that with access to my (extensive) medical notes, the receptionist may say 'Yes, it definitely is.' I think that would really unsettle me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[7) My thinking here is this might just show a little kinship with them. I could make light of it and say, 'Well, given both my parents died from heart attacks, I know one is coming for me'.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6) I don't know if that works. They might find that a little grim, or worry that having survived this heart attack, they won't survive the next.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[4) On the off-chance they don't recall I got them a Get Well Soon card, do I then say something along the lines of, 'Did you get my card?' Perhaps I throw it in as I squirt some hand gel into my hands at reception?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3) My instincts tell me you wait to be thanked for the card. But they may have received so many cards given their popularity with patients that they don't recall everyone that sent them a card.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2) I did get a card passed onto them during their convalescence. Do I wait to be thanked for the card? If they don't bring up the card, do I ask if they got the card?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1) Have to collect a prescription today. A long-serving member of staff at the surgery recently had a heart attack. I don't know what the protocol is here. If they're back, do I ask how they are, which would be some sort of acknowledgement I know they had a heart attack?]]></document>
