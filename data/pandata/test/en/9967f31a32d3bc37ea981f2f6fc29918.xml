mangoes for everyone appeared on blue plates,
each one cut in half and scored
and shoved forward from its rind, like an orange flower,
cubist and juicy.]]></document>

We went back to the car.]]></document>

carved out when an author traveled and a reader
kept the way open.]]></document>

like three tosses of silvery water,
they were gone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'd watch the face, how the mouth
has to work, and see any strain, any
sign of what lifted the voice.]]></document>

Three ladies pausing in indifferent space.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And the flowers, as daft as mud, poured out their honey.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[the air
finding every leaf and feather over
forest and water]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think of this every morning
as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If I stopped and thought, maybe
the world
can’t be saved,
the pain
was unbearable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But to tell the truth after a while I'm pale with longing

passed under my hands
and I have tried
to improve their peaceful
emptiness]]></document>

In the pine-crown

in the rivers of Pennsylvania
when the waters are low.
That size, and almost round.
Mossy green.]]></document>

of each flawed blossom rising and fading.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Next time what I'd do is look at
the earth before saying anything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Alone,
in the crown of the tree,
I went to China,
I went to Prague;
I died, and was born in the spring;
I found you, and loved you, again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and softly,
lamp-eyed,
becomes the perfect, billowing instrument
as it glides
through the wind
like a knife.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But it seems impossible.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[All night
in the brisk and shallow restlessness
of early spring
I think of her,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Then, I imagine, I would never move.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Around him, the villagers gathered
and stretched forward to listen.]]></document>

to be more than pure light
that burns]]></document>

that anything, in spite of its absence,
ever dies
a perfect death?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[we keep ourselves alive,
if we can, taking one after another
the necessary bodies of others, the many
crushed red flowers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[then they sat down,
each one with dainty, charcoal feet—
each one on a slender branch—
and looked at me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Every year
the lilies
are so perfect]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Later the darkness fell
and the solid moon
like a white pond rose.
But I wasn’t in any hurry.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I would like to write a poem about the world that has in it
nothing fancy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I didn't
even then move toward the fine point
of the story, but stood in my lonely body
amazed and full of attention]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it becomes
a trickle sharp as a hair that you follow
from the honey pot over the table]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But these are the woods you love,
where the secret name
of every death is life again—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[upon the brash
turnip-hearted skunk cabbage
slinging its bunches leaves up
through the chilling mud.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Clearly, now, the flower is a bird.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I didn't
even then move toward the fine point
of the story, but stood in my lonely body
amazed and full of attention]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[for forty years
the sheets of white paper have
passed under my hands
and I have tried
to improve their peaceful
emptiness]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I was standing
at the edge of the field—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[but still they asked for nothing
but the difficult life
which they had already.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[all the dreams of my blood
and all outrageous divisions of time
seem ready to leave,
to slide out of me.]]></document>

that striver,
that third eye—
can do a lot but
hardly everything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But the seed
has been planted, and when has happiness ever
required much evidence to begin
its leaf-green breathing?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[An owl cried in the distance,
I thought of Jesus, how he
crouched in the dark for two nights,
then floated back above the horizon.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[unspooling
like ribbons made of snow,
or god’s white hair.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[when they rose
out of their mortal bodies,
like a million particles of water
from a fountain,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[as death
rises up—
god’s bark-colored thumb—
and opens the sheath of its wings

and turns its hungry, hooked head
upon me, and away,]]></document>

even if they say nothing, or seem to say nothing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh, I could not have said it better
myself.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[All through the sweetness I heard voices,
men and women talking about something—
another country, and trouble.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Every morning
the world
is created.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One evening
I met the mango.
At first there were four or five of them
in a bowl.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Silence on a hill where the path ended
and then the forest below
moving in one long whisper
as evening touched the leaves.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[when they rose
out of their mortal bodies,
like a million particles of water
from a fountain,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One evening
I met the mango.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[as we glide
Over the final jutting mountainside,
Across the suburbs tangled in their lights,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Later, in the kitchen, I saw the stones
like torn-out tongues
embedded in the honeyed centers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[so it enters us—
in the morning
shines from brute comfort
like a stitch of lightning;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I wake earlier, now that the birds have come
And sing in the unfailing trees.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and for every person
the body glowing inside the clothes
like a light.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It fills you with the soft
essence of vanished flowers,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The wings of the moths catch the sunlight
and burn
so brightly.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Then, I imagine, I would never move.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Off they go,
hundreds of them,
like the black
fingerprints of the rain.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and you can't keep me from the woods, from the tonnage
of their shoulders, and their shining green hair.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The light burns upward,
it thickens and settles over the fields.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Like any of us
he wants to go to sleep,
but he's restless—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Dead leaves fell ruffling like an ugly lace
Down the brown hillsides, past some empty buildings.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No, we thought, if we thought
of anything, of the god of pleasure and good luck—
the god of a happy life.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In early June, at the edge of a field
thick with pink and yellow flowers
I meet them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Did you hear it, fluting and whistling
a shrill dark music,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A hundred gulls followed,
picking at the red streams,
as it sang its death song of vomit and bubbles,
as the blood ran from its mouth]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and, when the time comes to let it go,
to let it go.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[An owl cried in the distance,
I thought of Jesus, how he
crouched in the dark for two nights,
then floated back above the horizon.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[we keep ourselves alive,
if we can, taking one after another
the necessary bodies of others, the many
crushed red flowers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And did you feel it, in your heart, how it pertained to everything?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is always underfoot,
like a summons,
gravel-backed and mossy,
in every beetled basin—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Not in shyness but in disgust
the owl
turns its face from me and pours itself
into the air, hurrying
until it is out of sight—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[as it fell
like a stream of glowing syrup into
the dark water, as death
blurted out of that perfectly arranged mouth.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarred—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[a long sentence, expressing
the pleasures of the body in this world.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[all day I think of her—
her white teeth,
her wordlessness,
her perfect love.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[can reach out
their muscular arms and touch
only so many,]]></document>
