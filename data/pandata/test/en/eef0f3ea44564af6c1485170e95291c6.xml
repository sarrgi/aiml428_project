are breaking open again
from the black cave
of the night.]]></document>

dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Things wound themselves together the way they always do—
health, art, profit. Where to travel
for the best weather. Where to buy
the cheapest, the best and sweetest of anything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[the hundreds of ribs
housed in their smooth, white
sleeves of muscle moving it
like a happiness
toward the water, where some bubbles
on the surface of that underworld announced
a fatal carelessness.]]></document>

carved out when an author traveled and a reader
kept the way open.]]></document>

are moving across the landscapes,]]></document>

over the rocks,
all day and all night—]]></document>

of the fly amanita
glow in the pinewoods.]]></document>

among the pads and the grasses]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it is also this dazzling darkness
coming
down the mountain,
breathing and tasting;]]></document>

from which to choose a house
like a white flower—

and what a rebellion
to leap into it
and hold on,
connecting everything,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[to love what is mortal;
to hold it
against your bones knowing

swept into all the corners
of the cottage,]]></document>
