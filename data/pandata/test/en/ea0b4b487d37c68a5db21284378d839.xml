		<document><![CDATA[@DavidYazbek Well, your fantastic Sunday night made my Sunday night joyful. Not to mention, picking my favorite show @TheBandsVisit to sweep helped me win all the swag from the local @TheTonyAwards party. Congratulations! Can’t wait to see it for fifth time.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@WSPate @arielstachel Yes, me too! This was after a matinee on a cold January day, and I’m sure he had other places to be before having to return to the theatre.

		<document><![CDATA[@TheBandsVisit I've leaned in four times, actually, physically, leaned in. Sometimes, when I listen to the cast album at home, I find I'm doing the same. In six decades of seeing musical theatre, I can't remember anything like this. Congratulations on all the wins. I love this show so much!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@CarmiOnTheVerge @NicoleHertvik @Nat_Tuck @petermarksdrama I saw each twice. Tony was great no matter where I sat. Kashani was more subdued. Good enough if you sit in the orchestra; it didn’t read at all to me when I sat in the mezzanine.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@theatreguy22 @divarobbie I was surprised but pleased by the SpongeBob pick. The group watching with me loved that. Mama Will Provide conveyed the energy and spirit of OOTI. Omar Sharif is THE epitome of what TBV is about, but might not appeal to everyone. Sadly, the show won’t either. (I adore it!)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@WSPate @TheBandsVisit I saw Tony twice, then Dariush twice. Dariush is subtle. I found him hard to read from mezzanine, but wonderful when I was closer. But I still hear most of the show with Tony’s voice in my head. I’ll be going back too, but not until fall.]]></document>
