		<document><![CDATA[We don't dismiss our colleagues if they don't like what we like, we shouldn't dismiss our students for the same thing.

		<document><![CDATA[What we shouldn't do is try to 'make' them like a particular poem, play, or film. Hopefully they will but if they don't, that's OK.

		<document><![CDATA[I'm old (according to my children and my students) and I find 2001 and Barry Lyndon boring.
Students can like what they want. As teachers we should be asking them to appreciate the art, the creativity, what is being discussed and how it is being discussed. https://t.co/MUmvCik1MB]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I was at a talk where a poet put forward Dead Man as poetry and dismissed all 'Hollywood' movies as puerile prose. This clip, to me, shows that you can't have one without the other. To understand Dead Man as a poem you have to understand Westerns. https://t.co/06CCpA6VNH]]></document>
