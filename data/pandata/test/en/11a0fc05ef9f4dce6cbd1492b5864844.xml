		<document><![CDATA[@TheGDenise That must have been/be awful. 100%. I think of what those before me, others must do to survive. Perspective. Fetishization of overwork is so troublesome. Then there are the cultures that demand it regardless of need (eg. Where ppl volunteer for “jail” to avoid overwork). WTH.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheGDenise I (by sheer privilege and by choice) have hard boundaries when it comes to well-being and managing time. I love being a generalist with many interests and a small streak of introvertedness. Also, there isn’t one thing I’m expert enough at to substantiate a 24 hour work day. 😂]]></document>
