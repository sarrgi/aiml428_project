		<document><![CDATA[@patmccarry A few other suggestions for analysis: 1. How we have had zero tries from 4 TMO decisions in 2 games. 2: Franno’s point that Healy was entitled to pull down the maul once it was over our try line. No try. No sin binning.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@patmccarry After 10 years &amp; 265 front row games u bet he has previous. About 1 incident every 50+ games, ergo irrelevant. There are 100s of off the ball bumps, pinning, leg holding, hits 2 try scorers in every game. Why aren’t u running a campaign on Hayley-Petty game ending hit on Conway?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patmccarry On what basis do you think that warrants another look by officials? Purely due to Cheika remarks 1st &amp; media hype 2nd imho. There are literally 100s of other similar scenarios in every game.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ruggerblogger So do you ignore opinion based on fact? Most all of those tweets on Sam (he is a big &amp; accountable boy) aren’t even about the Grosso incident. He plays with a malicious edge. All those people and seasoned watchers/reporters in a wide variety of countries aren’t wrong You related?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patmccarry Well your editors are making a meal of it and I’d say I am closer to Uncle Joe’s wishes in asking that it be dropped as an unwelcome story. https://t.co/KJvlet4UPj have pushed it more than the Aussie media and “every little helps”!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ruggerblogger After 10 years &amp; 265 caps for Leinster &amp; Ireland His record shows he is clearly not. Very occasionally he is a reckless counter rucker. Has never ever rendered anyone unconscious or been involved in cracking skulls. Stamped on another prop’s ankle in 2013 was the worst in 10 yrs]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SportsJOEdotie @patmccarry Have to say your clickbait approach to the Healy-Genia non-event is not supportive of our team’s efforts with comments like “could be cited yet” &amp; “naughty”. Move on please]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ruggerblogger Search “Sam Cane” on Twitter and see how he is universally regarded. I think he is probably the most complete 7 in world rugby. But an unnecessarily dirty bugger which Pooper, McCaw &amp; Co don’t resort to. Deal with the truth https://t.co/yv6bl3Lwjz]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@BrianODriscoll Appreciate it’s a big call but I think Leavy is ahead of Seanie now because he is more of a team player and has better rugby intellect imho. Pace is the one thing he needs to work on most. Must be able to gain a metre by running less on his heels]]></document>
