		<document><![CDATA[When he announced that he and his buddies had been floating around since the 90s, the Khan reveal was inevitable. I was so furious I almost walked out of the theatre.

		<document><![CDATA[I was REALLY hoping he wasn't Khan bc that would've meant the genetically-engineered superhuman, humanity's peak, a mixed-race character with a Sikh name, played by a Mexican, would become… a white guy. Their perfect superhuman is a white guy.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[r/relationship_advice, for example, has a tendency toward homophobic microaggression

I haven't seen that as much on r/relationships, but

is that because there are fewer people there who might do that? Or is it because the most popular Qs on r/relationships are from straights?]]></document>
