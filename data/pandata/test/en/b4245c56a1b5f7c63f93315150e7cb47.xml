		<document><![CDATA[@knittyphd Oh thank you - will take a look!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is such an interesting exploration of the capability of objects (and the act of curation) to unsettle, intervene and disturb. It shows how different eyes can draw different narratives from collections. It brings things to life and is very exciting. 🌑]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[The exhibition dwelt on the anxiety &amp; emotions inherent in objects &amp; artworks. Postcards of the Dürer sketch and the devil floating in glass have sat on my desk throughout writing my thesis to remind me that objects are not always what they seem at first glance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I haven’t stopped thinking about Edmund de Waal’s ‘During the Night’ exhibition since I saw it at the Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien 3 years ago. So thrilled to finally own the catalogue, which is really more like a printed version of the exhibition. 🌑 https://t.co/FAXVerUxlp]]></document>
