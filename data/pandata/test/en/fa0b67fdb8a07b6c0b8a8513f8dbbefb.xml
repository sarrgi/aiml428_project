		<document><![CDATA[@johndodwyer @NWCI the brain and behaviour are inextricably linked you cannot separate them - I believe that you are saying the same thing as me - through engagement of our frontal lobes and higher order functions we can override our more basic 'unthinking' brain functions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@johndodwyer @NWCI the brain uses heuristics to function at a fundamental level but has the capacity for more refined &amp; nuanced thinking to override labelling when it goes beyond its functional purpose to prejudice etc - I think people forget that labels are shorthand but not the totality]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@johndodwyer @NWCI It is complex. How would you propose that we move away from labels to a society that treats all humans equally - is there not a need to identify where inequalities exist - and that in turn requires us to use some means of identification i.e. a label]]></document>
