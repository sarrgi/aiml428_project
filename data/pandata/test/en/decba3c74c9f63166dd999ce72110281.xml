thick with pink and yellow flowers
I meet them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[a jungle redeemed by these linked sentences
carved out when an author traveled and a reader
kept the way open.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[At any distance
it fell without a break or seam, and slowly, a simple
preponderance—
a fall of flowers—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The light burns upward,
it thickens and settles over the fields.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[that anything is ever final—
that anything, in spite of its absence,
ever dies
a perfect death?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and I want
to live my life all over again, to begin again,
to be utterly
wild.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall
back to the sea.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It lifts its head,
it lifts the hinges

of its snowy wings,
tossing a moment of light
in every direction,
like a chandelier,

and then once more is still.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and the ponds appear
like black cloth
on which are painted islands
of summer lilies.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And that was followed by, guess what, a momentous and
beautiful silence]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[all day I think of her—
her white teeth,
her wordlessness,
her perfect love.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it was
a flock of snow geese, winging it
faster than the ones we usually see,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In winter
all the singing is in
the tops of the trees
where the wind-bird
with its white eyes
shoves and pushes
among the branches.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Therefore I have given precedence
to all my sudden, sullen, dark moods
that hold you in the center of my world.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think of this every morning
as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't know the name of this bird,
I only imagine his glittering beak
tucked in a white wing
while the clouds—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't even think
of the eventual corruption of my body,
but of how quaint and humorous they are,
like a collection of doorknobs,
half-moons,
then a yellow drizzle of flying saucers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I want to believe that the imperfections are nothing—
that the light is everything—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and at night
lights up the deep and wondrous
drownings of the body
like a star.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I had nothing
better to do
than listen.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[as we glide
Over the final jutting mountainside,
Across the suburbs tangled in their lights,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And that was followed by, guess what, a momentous and
beautiful silence]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is always underfoot,
like a summons,
gravel-backed and mossy,
in every beetled basin—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The gospel of
light is the crossroads of—indolence, or action.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[clearly I'm not needed,
yet I feel myself turning
into something of inexplicable value.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Did you hear it, fluting and whistling
a shrill dark music,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You do not have to be good.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[yet I turn back
To sort the weeping ruins of my house:]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Whatever the subject, the morning sun
glimmers it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And Him, somewhere, ponderously lifting another world,
setting it free to spin, if it can,
in a darkness you can’t imagine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and for every person
the body glowing inside the clothes
like a light.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Dim with arthritis, time, the muddied seasons,
Grandmother poised in the back seat again,
Counting the cows.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[the hundreds of ribs
housed in their smooth, white
sleeves of muscle moving it
like a happiness
toward the water, where some bubbles
on the surface of that underworld announced
a fatal carelessness.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and truly it seemed
surprised by the unexpected kindness of the air and
light-hearted to be
flying at last.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Airy and shapeless thing,
it needs
the metaphor of the body,
lime and appetite,
the oceanic fluids;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Later
I opened his body and separated
the flesh from the bones
and ate him.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Some cows drank from a creek, and lurched away.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and then,
like three tosses of silvery water,
they were gone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I was standing
at the edge of the field—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Cold now.
Close to the edge. Almost unbearable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it becomes
a trickle sharp as a hair that you follow
from the honey pot over the table]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Well, who doesn’t want the sun after the long winter?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Surely
a beast might be clever, be lucky, move quietly
through the woods for years, learning to stay away
from roads and houses.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Shelter in winter that day—
a storm coming, but in the lee
of an island in a cover with friends—
oh, little bright cup of sun.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[what is it I might say
there in the orange light of early morning,
in the owl’s resting time,
that would have any pluck and worth in it?—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think of the blueberry fields, the blackberry tangles,
the cranberry bogs.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And the sky
with its new moon, its familiar star-trails,
burns down like a brand-new heaver,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Likely I visited all
the shimmering, heart-stabbing
questions without answers
before I climbed down.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You aren’t much, I said
one day to my reflection
in a green pond,
and grinned.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and, after all,
even if we came by some miracle
upon a language which we both knew,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But to tell the truth after a while I'm pale with longing
for their thick bodies ruckled with lichen]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But his big, round music, after all,
is too breathy to last.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and, being the color of snow, catching the sun
so they were, in part at least, golden.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Farms to both sides shook, bankrupt, in the wind.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Later the darkness fell
and the solid moon
like a white pond rose.
But I wasn’t in any hurry.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Wherever I am, the world comes after me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They're tired of sleep.
They have a new idea.
They want to swim away
into the world.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and then,
like three tosses of silvery water,
they were gone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But they did this
with no small amount of desperation—you might say: love.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Times in the morning early
when it rained and the long gray
buildings came forward from darkness
offering their windows for light.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[until the white snow is written upon
in large, exuberant letters,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it becomes
a trickle sharp as a hair that you follow
from the honey pot over the table]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It had taken the hook.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It could float, of course,
but would rather
plumb rough matter.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[each pond with its
blazing lilies
is a prayer heard and answered
lavishly,
every morning,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and to fly, for the first time,
in their sea-green helmets,
with brisk, metallic tails—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And in the evening
the piled firewood shifts a little,
longing to be on its way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[She steps into the dark swamp
where the long wait ends.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Out of pain,
and pain, and more pain
we feed this feverish plot, we are nourished
by the mystery.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[as we glide
Over the final jutting mountainside,
Across the suburbs tangled in their lights,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The ants bore into the peony bud and there is a dark
pinprick well of sweetness.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and every pond,
no matter what its
name is, is
nameless now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and at night
lights up the deep and wondrous
drownings of the body
like a star.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And did you see it, finally, just under the clouds—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[like a white candle—
or a man, in the distance,
in the clasp of some meditation—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Under the orange
sticks of the sun
the heaped
ashes of the night
turn into leaves again
and fasten themselves to the high branches—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[this isn't
a contest but the doorway
into thanks,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And have you too finally figured out what beauty is for?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[he has an idea,
and slowly it unfolds
from under his beating wings
as long as he stays awake.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[motionless
in those dark halls of honey.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think of this every morning
as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The domed head rose above the water, white
as a spill of milk.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Some cows drank from a creek, and lurched away.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Meditation is old and honorable, so why should I
not sit, every morning of my life, on the hillside,
looking into the shining world?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Nobody could count all of them—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One evening
I met the mango.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And settled softly on the earth once more
Rise in the fierce assumption of our lives—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I would like to write a poem about the world that has in it
nothing fancy.
But it seems impossible.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and died
in the slow pouring off
of rainbows.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I slept as never before, a stone on the river bed,
nothing between me and the white fire of the stars
but my thoughts,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it becomes
a trickle sharp as a hair that you follow
from the honey pot over the table]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So fancy is the world, who knows,
maybe the stars sing too,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Wherever it was
I was supposed to be
this morning—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Once, in the south,
I had this happen:
the soft rope of a water moccasin
slid down the red knees
of a mangrove,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is always underfoot,
like a summons,
gravel-backed and mossy,
in every beetled basin—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[an invisible line
upon which their iridescence caught fire
as the sun caught them, sliding down.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[sponging up and reflecting,
so brilliantly,
as it has for centuries,
the sun's fire.]]></document>
