		<document><![CDATA[@TamBouret @NEWeatherRants @jhomenuk I was as pro weather forum as they get but I don’t even visit these days. A lot of it comes down to where the smart folks are.. Twitter has more of them active than other places at the moment even if some like RTs too much.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jcolman22 More proof a lot of folks don’t care if the forecast ideas are right as long as they get 100 RTs out of it. Funny how guys with lots of letters after their name are often the worst at it.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@jhomenuk hah maybe. I feel like people on the wx forums had more restraint often. I know someone will stop by and be like well what else we got but I have never understood posting so many raw maps... other than hype and shares which is obv a motive of many.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@toweringCU @Indyweather24 yeah that could be true too. he is also a lot less charismatic so it's hard to see him being treated like a cult leader... or winning an election. but he def get the runnings of gov better.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@adolwyn I’m not sure tbh. I know there are gift regulations when in official capacity but seems odd they would go to this but perhaps in an overall ethics way. If so pretty dumb. I initially thought I’d go gov intel and then the longer not the less fun it sounded..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's possible the admin is wrong about ISIS being defeated and also right that we should not be there. Sitting ducks waiting to be drawn into a larger war. https://t.co/aN3SCNhajL]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stormchas4 I’ve been surprised how much you can see plants when you share them but it did seem a bit too large scale for that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stormchas4 Yeah on that for sure but there are also contrail something out there or there were.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GolferChris68 @stormchas4 That is rather creepy looking]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stormchas4 @IrishEagle yeah that was my eventual guess but an interesting looking case.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Twitter loves making gifs look the worst.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Better view..  IMBY centric. ;)  

Other thought was they could be contrail shadows. Now think that seems more likely. Looked like they were originating at Yeager or close but just trick of the mind. Lower deck here ~25k so would make sense as shadow. https://t.co/irDBQVndJH https://t.co/GhupwqJRMI]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@eguill25 @capitalweather twitter loves to butcher already soft image quality. there are gravity/mtn waves as well which are there almost all the time I guess so I almost don't notice them. better contrast here over WV. https://t.co/fTmeHrryn8]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TerpWeather @IrishEagle @stormchas4 do feel like it has to mostly be terrain. large spatially and matches more or less. https://t.co/npOLPOlmk9]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@antmasiello @shortstack81 you think there's much of a chance here? these are so hard to do but having the southern stream dominate in the end isn't crazy in a winter like this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BLynch74 it's a good deal different than prior runs with the northern stream but not crazy maybe. I feel like last weekend did this too if not as extreme.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @BLynch74: @islivingston Surface adjustments .. https://t.co/TNLO9zDB2i]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amosmagliocco I get that aspect but again I think the moral argument is twisted in various ways... we have barricades all over the place. 5b buys a certain amount of time and focuses the conversation in whatever ways. he only has so many more ops to ask if he loses etc etc. this is worse IMO.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_WxPhil_ it's not all paranoia but probably some.. hard not to be these days lol. he is better at this than many give him credit for. and it does seem to fit into his general wishes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Gotta watch out for #2019ing until we know what it is. GFS and still a way to go but 0z run is how you start to put the weekend in play here. Phase drags it north in majority of runs lately. If that doesn't happen.... more 'interesting.' https://t.co/jH1maq9KRE]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Weathermansam77 +1 on the bed frame]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@joshtimlin @crankywxguy def somewhere in there. the end of (mid-atlantic at least) winter bang hah. I'll be in Puerto Rico on presidents day weekend like a derp. I have liked end mo for a while although sometimes it feels graspy already. the cold/snow people never get tired of losing hah. broken clocks.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amosmagliocco honestly I still find myself angry with the party apparatus. I suppose it is because despite how I sound here I am truly not a Dem... but I just feel disappointed with them in almost every instance, which leads to anger. sometimes you gotta give to sneak around back and tackle.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@crankywxguy @joshtimlin lr analogs more cold than snowy.. as you'd expect if we have the coldest anoms in the hemisphere around. then again who knows if that verifies.. although it looks fairly legit. usually hard to get crazy cold and blizzards at same time. storm risk open and close makes more sense.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Ombresque I guess it's good I'm in no hurry to find a new job yet heh. I'm with the workers for sure. I guess I just see these as desperate times in many ways.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TamBouret @steveginx problem with America is everyone is rather comfortable and self interested. even now we have a lot of folks kicking the can down the road even though this is basically unheard of.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@amosmagliocco Makes sense in his end I suppose didn’t think of that. I just assumed he’s happy to let things rot since he hates gov to begin with. I get not budging now I guess but I don’t understand how that was the philosophy from the start. This seems worse than a wall.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @MuleskinerBrian: @islivingston All thats needed is a “sickout”. TSA one day and ATC the next. Hopefully the pilots would have their bac…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Weathermansam77 Agreed got my snow time for spring]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @Weathermansam77: @islivingston I hope the landmass also gets suppressed so my house just ends up in the tropics]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_WxPhil_ Yeah it seems made for him overall... which is partly why I don’t get the no budging idea from Dems. I guess at this point they have to stick to it but we might fall apart over some old people’s egos.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Ombresque If this goes on for months the same thing will happen. For some reason people still seem to have hope someone’s about to act. Will that be the same in 3 mo?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It would be pretty funny if we get two rainstorms then a bunch of suppressed OTS stuff when the big cold moves in. Oranges and blues and #wxporn oh my.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@steveginx no one is guaranteed anything. if this drags on for months it's not just hundreds of thousands of families that are destroyed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also @GOP is out of its mind enough to think this can go on indefinitely. Who are these people?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@crankywxguy pretty decent considering not much reports.. the 2011 was felt everywhere]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@jhatem I have a feeling as good as this storm was it’s not the storm of the season here.. altho I worry I will mix and dry slot in that one. I initially liked the end of the mo which i guess might be storm 2 ahead.. not sure I can get on board with the first.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Red_Head_Ed @rms5539 I undercut mos but not enough clearly. Although we may not be too far from lows already. 27 even at the Cathedral which runs cold. These are the times the city sucks... if you like cold that is]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 I started a personal study on this stuff once.. only big cities so far tho.. then it became really long and seemed kinda useless but siting/threading/etc is quite interesting. and a mess all over the place.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jhatem It’s usually hard to get mega storms when you’re the coldest place in the hemisphere but we have also had a storm every weekend for months. Also not atypical we open and close a lengthier cold pattern with storms.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 Dulles is in a weird spot sorta like a little bowl .. Manassas also loves to get really cold--not necessarily representative of the broader region in those sense either I suppose. 14 dew at Dulles compared to 19 on NAM earlier. you do forget when it never snows...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[As @rms5539 points out the fresh snow-pack is going to work outside the cities given clear skies. 

Currently 16 at Dulles and 30 at DCA. Note DCA is not alone in DC (or Baltimore). https://t.co/Zhb9msJ5gY]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I'd suppose there will at least be a blizzard going in and coming out of this pattern. Who gets what I dunno.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rms5539 hah looks like I forgot how to forecast temps with snow. dulles 16 -- thought dews were high enough to keep that from happening.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The 2016 period was considerably colder right after the week ended.. although we never seem to pull real lows these days so that was lame. The blizzard was on the way too. #ninoing]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I've had the sense in recent days a fair number of folks don't know that the precip shown is the 6 hours prior. This has not looked good locally for days,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_WxPhil_ @rms5539 Huh neat. Dulles reported fog but with quite high visibility. It is probably the little sheltered areas that are really tanking. But it is also true these kind of nights have much of the drop early I think.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I had not but I assumed their interest in shrinking the gov was part of it. The Dems have a long history of totally missing when they are in existential battles. One reason I'd have given him the money even if he doesn't deserve it. https://t.co/pXlhmGEo5J]]></document>
