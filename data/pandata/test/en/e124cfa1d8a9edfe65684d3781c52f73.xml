		<document><![CDATA[@ConroeBrooks @Dianaseamon1 This hurts so much to hear. I’m sorry that people can’t recognize generosity &amp; talent. I’m grateful to anyone who takes the time after a grueling performance to do the stagedoor. You don’t owe us this, and are certainly justified in choosing to take care of yourself instead.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ConroeBrooks I just took my friend to see Hamilton (my 8th time), and what she talked about more than anything was the amazing ensemble work.

		<document><![CDATA[@khjelmgaard @USATODAY Well, it’s quite clear that a centrist Republican Party died years ago. They have no norms nor civility in their grab for power.

Can't we just pursue our lives, with our children and our wives...how do you ignore

All the children
All the giants...
