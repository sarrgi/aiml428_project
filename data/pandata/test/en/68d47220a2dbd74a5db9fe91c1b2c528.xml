		<document><![CDATA[@CathieShiels @kburnskburns @GregHughes2 @DrOKennedy Thats only one of the issues. Vast majority of GPs from day one have said clearly they do not think GP is is right or safest or best place to deliver this service.

		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea It's one of the multiple reasons I gave you. And did say if we signed up for extra work would need more GP's.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@clairemariamac @SimonHarrisTD @susmitchellSBP @newschambers @FergalBowers That is a disgrace and should not happen. No excuse and members of the "public" would not be in any way affected (or tbh even know it is happening).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea Yes and I keep telling you we have no extra capacity, especially for a new service which we are not trained for and did not expect to have it landed on us. You don't accept that and that is your right, doesn't make it any less true though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea TOP]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@marybuckley549 @DrMaryRogan @williamhboney1 @TodaySOR As with any news story it is the extremes who get the coverage. 70% or more of GP's will be involved at some level. Most feel direct provision not something they can provide for various reasons but have no issue referring.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea No it doesn't as they are accessed elsewhere.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea TBF every time I address your queries you move on to another almost immediately. I think I've given you enough time already.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea Bottom line is that you don't seem to accept that most GP's feel we are not the right people to provide it, no training, no experience, no supports in place and insurance not yet confirmed will be available.  Also Nowhere else in Europe is it a GP lead service.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea Lack of training and experience is a fairly big issue don;t you think? Also lack of access to USS if needed and no clear pathway for referrals of complications in place.  LARC should be available from provider as well.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@marybuckley549 @DrMaryRogan @williamhboney1 @TodaySOR 70% or more of GP's are happy to refer women at the very least. There are a hard core of maybe 20% who will just not refer or engage at all.  Of the 70% its 10-30% who will actually act as direct providers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea The straight answer is that it depends. Would probably need to be able to increase  the number of GP's we have to be able to do that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea It was effectively forced on the profession and the minister of the day lied through his teeth with promises about reviews and a full new contract by june 2017. A good number of GP's did not sign up]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea Yes]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea I am very pro it but it needs to be resourced, to provide it we need a lot more GP's. Thew U6 contract has almost crucified the profession and took any capacity there was and more.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea The is no capacity at all, any increase at all in workload cannot be facilitated]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea TOP provision is just not a routine GP service,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea So you think I should be training for something I don't think we have the capacity for and where the clinical pathways have not yet been set up for?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@williamhboney1 @TodaySOR OK, given they have say 1000 public patients each and there are 4-5k GP's, who is going to care for the 1,000,000 patients who are suddenly without a GP?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea And I answered your question by telling you we do not know. If you cannot accept that as an answer I'm sorry..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea Because you will have to do extra training and keep up to date, thats on top of an already onerous CME work load. Also will have to be prepared, even one TOP will require 3 long consults under the apparent rules. Ask how many GP's have a spare 1-2 hours in any given week?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@williamhboney1 @TodaySOR Firstly I'm pro choice so thats were I am coming from, secondly there are simply going to be a hard core who will not refer. A generation of being taught it is illegal and unethical will not vanish overnight or by coercion.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea The numbers are a 2 way issue, too few and skill levels will not be kept up to date, too many and the capacity simply isn't there. (that assumes and its a big assumption, that all the necessary sup[ports will be in place).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anitambyrne @TheresaNewIdea 2 issues there, GP's do not act as providers in any other European country (bar in limited circumstances if France.) We have no idea how many will seek the service?  PS GP's here have zero training in TOP (zero), any training will have to be from a base of zero.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@williamhboney1 @TodaySOR Reality is some will not refer, 24 hour hotline if done properly will by pass that. 70% of GP's though happy to refer.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheresaNewIdea At the end of the day we are introducing a brand new service here and had a chance to do in a a world class way with maximum buy in from stakeholders. Instead we went for the easy option and tried to sneak it in while winging it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheresaNewIdea At present we can on tell women to go to AE, and re point two. I think the polite way to describe those signing up is naive.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheresaNewIdea There was no vote allowed and the ICGP board have to date ignored the views of majority of GPs on this. We lack the training, capacity and proper referral pathways. ICGP policy driven by some very odd interests.]]></document>
