		<document><![CDATA[@evora1907 @aheimert I do also know people about my age in gov that have moved up the $ ladder extremely fast. I guess I can't totally convince myself they did that much more work than I did... but life isn't fair.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@evora1907 @aheimert I agree and there is nuance to everything which is usually missed here at least initially. The DC non profit world in some ways preys on young people convinced they are about to help the world. Comparing a think tank to gov is apples to oranges for sure.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidMRohde Trump has a knack for wedge issues.  I am totally with the fed employees and against him but I can sense my comment here was not taken that well by some who've seen it so far... so yeah. Our country's main product is squabbling.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rlviser yes -- it's not a totally fair comparison. A place like Brookings is almost the opposite (like they have a law against raises hah). some is needing to bounce around to rise now but sometimes sucks to think I could be around 100k per yr instead of waaaaaay less.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidMRohde no I didn't think that. I just assume the media overfocuses on a few places that food is pouring in etc. as some nws folks here have mentioned ... in their towns people don't even know feds work there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stormchasernick we're so great it's hard to remember what great is.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidMRohde for sure, although I'm guessing the stories of the giving are more than the actualities. the fed gov is an easy target.. people on both sides can find faults without much effort. but it is still necessary for our way of life.]]></document>

it is true ... I also worked in a field where people were highly educated. I would be embarrassed to share my salary increase over 12 years lol.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SnarkyEM this is pretty key overall. https://t.co/qWuuFtnGJv]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CogNerd yes most likely although in some senses I think it goes beyond. Every now and then I hear salaries of NWS guys not far out of school.. they start quite low but move up quite quick. I was in the non profit world so it's a bad comparison there I suppose.]]></document>
