		<document><![CDATA[13/ As more allocators spend more time in crypto, I would not take it for granted that everyone will recognize that Bitcoin is the one and only hardest money, and that everything else is just children's toys

Good luck pitching the pyramid scheme to the board

{fin}]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[12/ But wait, there is no strict reason why the underlying platform should accrue value, even if tremendous value is tokenized on top

Yes, but all cryptocurrencies receive the ~98% of Bitcoin's hard money properties "for free" because of the beauty of public key cryptography]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[11/ What's the narrative that causes asset allocators to say "Holy shit, at $10T, crypto is *dramatically undervalued* because [some platform] is on a clear path to tokenize *all of the world's value*]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[10/ The latter resonates.

Let's fast forward a few years when crypto is worth $10T. Larger than gold. A lot of money starts to wonder "how much bigger can this get than gold? It's neo-gold sure, but gold has been around for 2000+ years!"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[9/ The other answer is "All of the capital in the world - currency, real estate, bonds, equity, commodities, and equity - will be tokenized, as tokenization is *the right way* to manage value ownership and transfer. The TAM is ~$250-500T depending on how you count"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[8/ One answer is "dapps, web3, and a ton of amazing things you can't even imagine yet. It's the next Internet!"

This is a pretty poor argument IMO, but it does resonate with some. I don't care for it because it anchors too heavily on the Internet without justifying that anchor]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[7/ These asset managers often ask

"You say this stuff can be worth $50T+. What possible story can justify that valuation beyond just digital gold (aka pyramid)?"

I think there are only two plausible answers, and one of them is pretty loose]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6/ You can argue that this is missing the bigger picture - about how you denominate wealth to begin with - but there are *a lot* of asset managers and UHNWI individuals who believe in investing in things that are efficient --&gt; improve productivity in the macro economic sense]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/ Perhaps the ultimate manifestation of this world view is Buffet, who *rails* on gold. His rant goes something like this

You can take all the gold in the world and put it in a room. 10 years later, it will have sat there, and not produced any value. Gold is therefore worthless]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/ About half of them "get" the hard money / digital gold narrative

The other half, not so much

They basically call out Bitcoin for what it is: a pyramid scheme!

Then they ask why they should invest in a pyramid scheme?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ For those of you reading this on twitter, recognize the tremendous selection bias at play: that you even follow me on Twitter

In the last few months, I've been talking to the CIOs of a lot of major endowments and pensions who collectively manage trillions in assets

Trillions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ In order for Bitcoin to work, Bitcoin *must* be evangelized

For a given evangelist, the process goes like this

a) learn about Bitcoin
b) buy bitcoin
c) tell everyone else to buy Bitcoin, and that all other cryptos are nonsense

Can't get more pyramid than that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ Bitcoin maximalists rightly espouse Bitcoin as the best, hardest money every devised. They recognize Bitcoin's for its strengths.

And they're right]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[0/ Bitcoin is *by definition* a pyramid scheme / multi-level marketing scheme

To be fair, it's the most "fair" and egalitarian pyramid scheme ever devised, but it is none the less a pyramid scheme]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ Another counter is that LTC is faster than BTC because of its 2.5 minute block time. If you want fast blocks, you can use literally anything that's not Bitcoin: ETH, ZEC, XMR, XLM, XRP, etc

Also, payments use case is stupid for long term value retention (velocity problem)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ If you buy LTC so you can convert to BTC.... then you just sold the LTC you bought... sounds like the velocity problem to me!

For the uninitiated, see here - https://t.co/gXqi1IHqSj]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ The general theme of these counter arguments is that we don't understand that lightning can work across BTC and LTC, and that LTC can help onboard users to lightning

Let's say that does turn out to be true. What then?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[0/ If you are still an LTC believer, you should see the LTC community's responses to our "hit piece"

Not one of these counters justifies a single marginal buyer]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@joeykrug @koeppelmann Yes global liquidity

Just not a single order book :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@joeykrug @koeppelmann Other argument against single liquid pool is lack of incentive. New players always trying to carve out their own liquidity pools, and the biggest have low incentive to share

It's a nice idea in theory. But the world has too much entropy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@joeykrug @koeppelmann In a world where all value transfers are just digital signatures on messages flowing over IP, I suspect all historical reasons for inefficient arbing to bridge liquidity go out the window]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@joeykrug Economic actors are incentived to ensure multiple liquidity pools

Just because ADRs are hard to arb is function of legacy fiat+equity infrastructure, crypto will become seamless

Tiny lack of efficiency doesn't matter. You can get 99.x% without single global pool]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[5/ Internally at Multicoin, we do *not* all agree that the hypothesis presented in this post is going to play out, and that the front end will fork out the back end.

		<document><![CDATA[4/ I've been a long-time @stratchery fan, and believe in the aggregation theory framework, and so I brought this up in our internal discussions about where we should invest in the Augur ecosystem]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ We've been watching the Augur launch very closely, and have been fascinated to see the nascent ecosystem already sprouting around it, e.g. https://t.co/7MhzxvAPgl and some other stealth teams]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ Rather, we believe in fat protocols because we believe that the native token of a smart contract platform is most likely to become a global digital reserve asset that's worth tens of trillions of dollars]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ We've spent a lot of time debating the fat protocols internally. And we are ardent believers, though not for the reasons that Joel discussed in his original essay]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[4/ So the question now is, at what price does all of the money that's on the sidelines - all of the people who're saying $6k is the ceiling - finally get off the sidelines because the perceived upside is enough?

Things are about to get much uglier before they get better

{fin}]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ But here's where some reflexivity kicks in

Now that those people have said $6k is a ceiling, why on earth would they buy at $5500, which implies they have &lt;10% upside?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ You should assume all of these people are talking their book - that they're mostly out of the market, and possibly even net short

If that's the case, then you should buy now, before they do]]></document>
