		<document><![CDATA[@DIfferent_Name2 Best thing might be laying an entire concrete slab and go for one that has a sloping roof from front to back rather than an apex - less potential for repairs and damage and more room inside, too. We did that in last house, worked well :-)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DIfferent_Name2 Not an expert but it’s wood from me; good choice environmentally, easy to paint and maintain for decades if it’s put on a proper base and you can get some really pretty ones too that fair lift a garden. :-)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[This is brilliant. But the references to the ‘Brits’ leading the conversation is misleading given Scottish votes &amp; Scottish familiarity with the problems discussed re Irish perspective.

		<document><![CDATA[@AmidPrivilege Isn’t that ironic in the extreme - Many Trump voters think they’re voting for power, strength, preservation of times gone by... what they’re really getting is something totally new; something smaller, weaker, less connected and less influential. 🤔 Same with Brexit, of course.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Changing my ending to emphasise the point re kids &amp; curriculum; when we normalise playground behaviours that victimise people, i.e., ‘kids, huh!’, we facilitate the behaviours’ transition to adulthood via conditioning, extrapolating out then and into ALL relationships.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We need to add awareness about Gaslighting to the curriculum too, IMO. Kids often use it as a playground tactic in cliques - it’s such an accessible, self-presenting power-play, so it’s really important we learn how to identify, neutralise &amp; replace it with honest communication.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[On a micro (‘toxic’ friend, colleague, family member etc.) and macro (Farage, Trump, ISIS, Hitler) basis, this is the semi-sophisticated, triple-bluff art of gaslighting; weaponising disadvantage to protect a goal the perpetrator knows to be flawed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Farage will simply exploit the lack of knowledge, filling the gap with unscrutinised fiction, waving the monarchy around, plus an occasional Morris dancer and a steak &amp; kidney pie as ‘evidence’ of a ‘successful’ nation and, with the help of sensationalist media bias, job done.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This lie will get huge traction because UK curriculum at primary &amp; secondary levels fails spectacularly on including content &amp; discussion on our modern politics and impact on other countries. We could learn &amp; adapt so much from Germany here, to our HUGE benefit.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Gaslighters are particularly good at calling other people/issues by names that apply much more fittingly to themselves. Gaslighting most effective when the perpetrator gets opportunity to tell their lie repeatedly in airspace they control. Repetition of the lie is absolutely key. https://t.co/nobjEhdktc]]></document>
