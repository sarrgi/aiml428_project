blossoms rounding to berries, leaves,
handfuls of grain.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And that was followed by, guess what, a momentous and
beautiful silence]]></document>

a contest but the doorway
into thanks,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I was standing
at the edge of the field—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[that it is more than the sum
of each flawed blossom rising and fading.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't even think
of the eventual corruption of my body,
but of how quaint and humorous they are,

the black,
mid-summer ponds.]]></document>

like the thinnest of blades]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and at night
lights up the deep and wondrous
drownings of the body
like a star.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So now there are two. And they walk together
like a dream under the trees.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and softly,
lamp-eyed,
becomes the perfect, billowing instrument
as it glides
through the wind
like a knife.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[an invisible line
upon which their iridescence caught fire
as the sun caught them, sliding down.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I go down to the edge of the sea.
How everything shines in the morning light!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[then they rose, tiny fireworks,
into the leaves
and hovered;]]></document>

like a white flower—

and what a rebellion
to leap into it
and hold on,
connecting everything,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Alone,

I went to China,
I went to Prague;

are breaking open again
from the black cave
of the night.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[as the blood ran from its mouth
that had no speech to rail against this matter—
speech, that gives us all there may be of the future—
speech, that makes all the difference, we like to say.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The light burns upward,
it thickens and settles over the fields.]]></document>

wings of the tumbling water
I never could have
imagined.]]></document>

one boot to another—why don't you get going?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The frogs freeze
into perfect five-fingered
shadows, but suddenly the flower
has fire-colored eyes

and one of the shadows vanishes.]]></document>

you have ever dared to pray.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[a snowbank, a bank of lilies,
Biting the air with its black beak?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[what a pearly rubble
from which to choose a house
like a white flower—

		<document><![CDATA[But to tell the truth after a while I'm pale with longing
for their thick bodies ruckled with lichen]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think
of the thickness of the serious woods
around the dark bowls of the Truro ponds;]]></document>

with its new moon, its familiar star-trails,
burns down like a brand-new heaver,]]></document>

even if we came by some miracle
upon a language which we both knew,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But what in this world
is perfect?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I slept as never before, a stone on the river bed,
nothing between me and the white fire of the stars

		<document><![CDATA[as it fell
like a stream of glowing syrup into
the dark water, as death
blurted out of that perfectly arranged mouth.]]></document>

bunch up and boil down
from the north of the white bear.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The line they refused to cut ran down like a birth cord

the broken cupboard of the clam,
the opened, blue mussels,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Then we all said goodbye
and kissed, on the black lawn, like strangers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and then,
like three tosses of silvery water,
they were gone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[After salmon and salads,
mangoes for everyone appeared on blue plates,
each one cut in half and scored
