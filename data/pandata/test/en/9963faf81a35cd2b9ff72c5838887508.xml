scrapes his orange breast
on the thick pines,]]></document>

about the bird, it was
something about the way
stone stays
mute and put, whatever
goes flashing by.]]></document>

shadows seem to grow shoulders.]]></document>

through my own soul,
opening its dark doors—]]></document>

as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I can hardly believe
their lapped light crowding
the black,
mid-summer ponds.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[and I want
to live my life all over again, to begin again,
to be utterly
wild.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[can reach out
their muscular arms and touch
only so many,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Did you hear it, fluting and whistling
a shrill dark music,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[there is still
somewhere deep within you
a beast shouting that the earth
is exactly what it wanted --]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So fancy is the world, who knows,
maybe the stars sing too,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Discarding smoothly, as we disembark,
All thoughts that held us wiser for moment]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[how the old couple
had almost nothing to give
but their willingness
to be attentive—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[upon the brash
turnip-hearted skunk cabbage
slinging its bunches leaves up
through the chilling mud.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And did you see it, finally, just under the clouds --]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[without a pinch of hope
or a single unfulfilled desire]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.]]></document>

the pain
was unbearable.]]></document>

for their thick bodies ruckled with lichen]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[how the old couple
had almost nothing to give
but their willingness
to be attentive—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarred—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I held my breath
as we do
sometimes
to stop time
when something wonderful
has touched us]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It could float, of course,
but would rather
plumb rough matter.]]></document>

deep in the forest you
shuffle up some tree, you rip the bark,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I can only stare.
She is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Something
just now
moved through my heart
like the thinnest of blades]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[a taste
composed of everything lost, in which everything lost is found.]]></document>

of it will haunt all that follows in my life.]]></document>

the pleasures of the body in this world.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Up there alone, in the impartial dark.]]></document>

so happy to be where they are, on the beach, instead of being
locked up in gold.]]></document>

said the Buddha,
before he died.]]></document>

into the white fire of a great mystery.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What blazes the trail is not necessarily pretty.]]></document>

and tangibility,
to be understood,
to be more than pure light
that burns]]></document>

wild.]]></document>

the cranberry bogs.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The gospel of
light is the crossroads of—indolence, or action.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[So fancy is the world, who knows,
maybe the stars sing too,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and to do this
I will go indoors to my desk --
I will sit in my chair --
I will look back
into the lost morning]]></document>

To sort the weeping ruins of my house:]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My mother's tightening fingers
Scratched at the roads that would take us home.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[On the far shore
a white bird is standing
like a white candle --]]></document>

romps, breaking the new snow
with wild feet.]]></document>

has just risen from sleep
and is staring
down the mountain.]]></document>

He looked into the faces of that frightened crowd.]]></document>
