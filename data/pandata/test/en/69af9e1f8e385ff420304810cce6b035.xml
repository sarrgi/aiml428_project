		<document><![CDATA[What is the gender balance in those, creative, industries? Where is the push for students to get involved in those?
Some of these require both a creative and a STEM frame of mind.
Where is the push for that combination?
Time for some perspective.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I'm enjoying The Doctor, but not the stories. Very linear, a+b+c=d. Nothing different, nothing quirky, nothing where you'd say 'how the hell did they think of that'. And the pacing seems off. Very slow, without the usual punchy dialogue.
