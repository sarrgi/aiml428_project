		<document><![CDATA[@lumpinthethroat @ellen_desmond There is that ‘best avoided’ convo - so unhelpful. And perhaps often a subterfuge used by folks who just don’t want to admit they’re low on facts &amp; high on hearsay?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@acraftycow @TatMum_Blog I think this woman is quite rare in having parents who could even consider bailing her out. I paid rent from 16, the moment I had a job. Maybe @GraziaUK are after the landed gentry market? Their story does not represent the young women I know at all....]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TatMum_Blog @GraziaUK I honestly cannot think of one young woman I know at the moment who isn’t scrambling against the odds to be independent, often exhausting themselves and never wasteful. @GraziaUK chose a bizarre story to tell, in this political climate.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@kirstofcomms It’s absolutely shocking. My Mum kept me as informed as she could and Irish friends have helped over the years too but honestly, this is CORE to even a basic understanding of current UK &amp; Westminster and it’s just... completely absent (as far as I’ve seen in state schools).]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Completely this. My kids, 16 &amp; 18, both taught nothing in school about Ireland, many of their friends have no clue there’s a republic, FFS.
