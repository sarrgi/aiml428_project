My family don't watch Doctor Who, they don't like it, so I'm quite happy nothing has changed, I still get the room to myself for 40 odd minutes.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Darren_Mooney I can't remember episodes like you do but agree that this one was only 'grand'. Bit too slow in parts, but too forced in others. Was disappointed with the Predator stuff.
But it's Doctor Who and Doctor Who is awesome! And the new Doctor and her crew look like great fun.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@noelahogan That's appalling. The fact that students rarely ask for recheck at this level means that this won't be highlighted. The result is an insult to 15 yr olds.
