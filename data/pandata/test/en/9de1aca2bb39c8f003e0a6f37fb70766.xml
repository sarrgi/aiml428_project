		<document><![CDATA[20/ However, if you have any priority other than "withstand full frontal government assault" then the options for security and consensus become... looser and more interesting

{fin}]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[19/ And to be clear, everything I've said above goes out the window if you assume the attacker is not economically motivated - ie a government

Certainly systems like EOS are far more susceptible to such attacks than Bitcoin]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[18/ I don't mean to dismiss the value of academically rigorous BFT consensus research. But it is worth considering how a network can bootstrap it's way to success through sheer economics]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[17/ What's my point in all of this? To defend EOS? Not really

Rather, to argue that any sufficiently valuable network becomes extra-ordinarily difficult to attack in an economically profitable way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[16/ Based on the back of the envelope math above, you just sit still

(also, if it's a cartel, coordinating this attack is even harder as anyone can bail anytime... prisoner's dilemma)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[15/ So if you're a BP cartel, what do you do? Do you just sit still and collect money in a growing system, or do you try to pull off the greatest attack of all time?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[14/ Looking at these round numbers, it seems pretty clear that pulling off this attack profitably would be impossible today, and even still extraordinarily difficult as short markets develop]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[13/ Today, the market cap of EOS is about $5-6B. So You'd need to short $2B of EOS

And as the marketcap of EOS grows, the amount in $ terms that you need to short grows too]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[12/ So in order to pull this off profitably, you'd need to get a short on 20-25% of all of EOS to break even, and then you'd probably want to be able to short another 30-40% of EOS to justify the risk

Or in other words, you'd need to short 50% of EOS]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[11/ If this BP cartel has truly cornered the market on EOS voting, that means that they collectively control/strongly influence a massive percentage of the EOS tokens. Likely somewhere on the order of 20-25% (about 45% of EOS tokens are voting today)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[10/ So the question facing this BP cartel is: do you short EOS and wreck the market, or do you simply collect inflation in a growing system?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[9/

Proving censorship is difficult, but possible, especially if censorship is happening at scale. Unclear how the market would react if this were to happen

Producing invalid state transitions that steal people's money would almost certainly cause the price to fall off a cliff]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[8/ Broadly speaking, they can do two things:

1) censor transactions
2) produce invalid state transitions (take your money without your consent)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6/  So the real question is, what is that threshold? Is it $1B or $10B?

I suspect it's somewhere in the neighborhood of $10B.

Let's use EOS, which is the butt of most consensus jokes, as a though experiment]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/ That at some level of scale - in the case of BTC at $100B - that attacking the network is simply not economically worth it.

Of course, this doesn't mean that the network won't be attacked by soverigns who are not economically motivated]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/ Now, miners could short BTC to hedge the risk and even profit on the way down, but again, they chose not to exploit the system at all

So what does this tell us?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ The only incentive-compatible explanation for miners choosing not to exploit is that if they got caught, they expected the price of BTC to plummet so much that their investments in mining hardware would lose the substantial majority of their value

Or simply ideology]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ If #2 was in the fact the case - and there's no way to prove this - then this stands as the single largest game-theoretic test in the history of crypto

For the purposes of this test, let's assume that they did know

What does this mean? What can we extrapolate?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ The Bitcoin CVE bug that allowed miners to violate the supply schedule, but that was never actually exploited, is an incredible case study

There are two fundamental explanations for why the bug wasn't exploited:

1) no miners knew about the bug
2) miners chose not to exploit]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[3/ perhaps the most amazing thing about ethereum is that it has both a strong community and a very aggressive product vision

That may be the winning combo

		<document><![CDATA[2/ But at some point, you have to cross the chasm.

The next marginal bitcoin buyer doesn't care *at all* about Jimmy song, Pierre rochard, safaediean, Bitcoin core, etc

They care about monetary policy, censorship resistance, being self sovereign

Or in other words, the product]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ anyone willing to engage in an online community is by definition a power user, an early adopter. In the early days, founders are surrounded by community

In the early days, community is key

But strong community in no way guarantees perpetual growth. And is possibly counter productive

		<document><![CDATA[@bloqboard ok done. feedback:

1) The language/semantics around wrapping/unwrapping, making assets availability for liquidity is confusing

2) You should combine the process of loan repayment + getting colateral back into into one tx. The second step was confusing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[20/ In summary:

Peer-to-peer trust on a micro-scale isn't a bug in the legacy payment system, but a feature of basic human social interaction. Trust is a lubricant for building relationships

{fin}]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[19/ Even if true, it doesn't matter because each trust relationship is so small]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[18/ You could make the argument that there are 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 instances each in which micropayments reduce some trust barrier, and that the aggregate of those is greater than the macro central bank trust problem]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[17/ There are broadly speaking, 2 forms of trust. Macro and micro.

Crypto in general solves the macro trust problem - that my purchasing power can't be arbitrarily reduced, can't be censored, can't be seized]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[16/ When finished, the charging station sees that actual usage was $25.50, so they charge visa for that tesla $25.50.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[15/ "What about public infrastructure"

Let's consider the future magical autonoous tesla that needs to charge. It pulls up to the charging station. No humans. It knows it needs ~$25 of charge. So it uses visa to pre-auth $25, gets the charge.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[14/ "But what about selling anonymized machine data for IOT analytics?" 

Ok great, you can batch the data and send it once a day. You can even stream it live, and receive payment every 24 hours. If they stop paying, you stop sending data. Easy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[13/ First, let's consider a factory/refinery/large scale industrial operation.

There's no need for machines to pay one another. They are all owned by the same company. No point in transferring money from your left pocket to your right pocket]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[12/ And then there's machine to machine (M2M) payments. This one is the most vague argument that micropayment proponents make

"But there will be use cases you can't even imagine yet."

Bullshit.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[11/ It sounds nice in theory as each item is delivered, that that the customer pays. Eg as each of the 1M widgets arrives, pay 1/1Mth the total

Why not just pay 50% before, 50% after, and trust the counterparty who you're going to buy/sell the next 1M widgets from anyways?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[10/ Next let's talk about freight / b2b.

Why the hell are invoices are net30? This is mostly a function of the pre-Visa era, when payments were processed with checks. It's also a function of the fact that credit cards aren't really intended for $100K+ b2b transactions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[9/ Even if newspapers could have charged $.10 / article, they would have failed because competitors would've pushed the price down to $0 anyways

Also, it's too mentally expensive for consumers, even the poorest consumers, to make $.10 decisions. Nick Szabo has written about this]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[8/ In the era of the Internet, content providers began competing with Facebook, Youtube, Netflix, and the long tail of blogs for the same amount of consumer attention]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[7/ Paying for media online. Eg $.10 / article

The problem with online media in the age of the Internet is that their scope of competition increased 1,000,000x. In the paper era, printing presses had to be local, so competition was limited.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6/ The three examples that micro-payments proponents cite are: paying for media online, net 30 b2b payments, and machine-to-machine payments

Let's walk through each and debunk why they don't matter:]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/ Prepaid cellphone: consumer trusts carrier to provide the minutes
Postpaid cellphone: carrier trusts consumer to pay
Prepaid gas: consumer trusts gas station to provide the gas
Uber: pre-auth some charge, and finalize exact amount later
Business freight: pay net 30]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/ In practice, society solved this hundreds of years ago through trust (aka counterparty risk) and batching of payments. Examples:]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ There is a particular elegance to the idea of streaming payments:

Receive one byte of data, pay for one byte of data!

No counterparty risk!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ But trusting a central bank to manage the monetary supply and trusting that the gas station short changed you on the gas that you pre-paid for are very different things]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ The foundation for crypto is reducing trust in 3rd parties, therefore allowing everyone to be self-sovereign. This started with Bitcoin and money, and the vision has since expanded to all personal data as part of the broader web3 vision]]></document>
