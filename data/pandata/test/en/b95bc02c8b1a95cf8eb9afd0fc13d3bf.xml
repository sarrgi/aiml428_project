		<document><![CDATA[@EmmaQuinlan @lisasaputo @kevinmcgahern I presume you mean they aren't involved after conception? They would be a small minority of pregnancies.

		<document><![CDATA[@lisasaputo @Gordonwdarcy @Together4yes @AndyLeeBoxing @RichieSadlier @kevinmcgahern @ConMurphySport It's simple really, you either accept the father exists or you don't. We all agree the woman decides if she has sex (he should also agree by the way), decides if she consults the father &amp; if she decides to termnate their pregnancy. Its just a little courtesy to the other parent.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lisasaputo @Gordonwdarcy @Together4yes @AndyLeeBoxing @RichieSadlier @kevinmcgahern @ConMurphySport You seem to want men to perfom biologically &amp; democratically to order &amp; then get out of the way.

I am calling for the role of the father to be included in the discusssion before the mother decides.

		<document><![CDATA[@lisasaputo @Gordonwdarcy @Together4yes @AndyLeeBoxing @RichieSadlier @kevinmcgahern @ConMurphySport No. That is not close to what I am saying. You misrepresent me.

		<document><![CDATA[@Gordonwdarcy @Together4yes @AndyLeeBoxing @RichieSadlier @kevinmcgahern @ConMurphySport I agree with the core sentiment of ur tweet but what role do u think the father's of the pregnancy have?

		<document><![CDATA[@BigDunc123 I agree that the mother should be the primary decision maker but it is also a man's business if he is the father of the pregnancy (other than a rapist). He should be asked his view and support the mother as much as possible.]]></document>
