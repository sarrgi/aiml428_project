		<document><![CDATA[@ianmck24 Pretty sure I never said that was our only claim to being relevant. Touch line ban for noising up you’re lot? Worth it everytime!!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ianmck24 Love how much we get under your skin. It’s beautiful to watch how much you all take pleasure in Hibs losing. Testament to how much we have improved recently. Please, keep quoting tweets about us while saying we are irrelevant. Cause that’s just contradicting what your saying!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ianmck24 Beat you twice last season at Ibrox, took you to the last game of the season to see us off for third and beat you in you’re only major final. I’d still say we are fairly relevant. Thanks for keeping up to date with us 😁👍🏽]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Lmc2105 @KWR07 Couldn’t agree more. Boyle so out of position tonight, couldn’t use his pace and Kamberi looked a yard of the pace. MacLaren has to play and we need more creativity in the middle of the park.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MichaelLinton27 @hibsboy69 @JamesLu28978099 @Atko__ Yeah, like them all. Kamara would be my pick of the bunch. But would happily take any of them. Mulumbu wants to go south again I believe. Should have some money to try and sway him though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@hibsboy69 @JamesLu28978099 @MichaelLinton27 @Atko__ Spot on. He’s gave us a threat from midfield, as well as set pieces that we have badly needed.

		<document><![CDATA[@JamesLu28978099 @MichaelLinton27 @Atko__ And your telling me that all the attributes they have now they had when they started? No. Doesn’t like a tackle at the moment, but he will soon learn in a Lennon team that’s part and parcel. Once again, he’s been here literally weeks. Played a big part besides tackling.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JamesLu28978099 @MichaelLinton27 @Atko__ Can’t disagree he’s missing certain parts to his game, but look at other players Lennon has improved. Give the boy time. Season has barely started.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MichaelLinton27 @JamesLu28978099 @Atko__ We must have said similar about McGinn and McGeough when they both signed.

		<document><![CDATA[@MichaelLinton27 @JamesLu28978099 @Atko__ His goal threat and wide balls are great. But close passing and creative passing needs work. Still a great player/prospect.]]></document>
