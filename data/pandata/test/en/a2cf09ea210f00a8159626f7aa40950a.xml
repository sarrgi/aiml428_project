		<document><![CDATA[All night I heard the small kingdoms
breathing around me, the insects,

which is the only argument there is
against the sea.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Her child leaps among the flowers,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Later, in the kitchen, I saw the stones

of their song
into the air.]]></document>

the gods loved them
and blessed them—]]></document>

runaway dog. But the seed
has been planted,]]></document>

the piled firewood shifts a little,
longing to be on its way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and, after all,
even if we came by some miracle
upon a language which we both knew,]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[like the rain pelting the trees, like a waterfall
nifing down the black ledges?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[to send up the first
signal—a white fan
streaked with pink and violet,
even green.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[at night
in the black branches,
in the morning
in the blue branches
of the world.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[By now the hawk has flown five miles
at least,
dazzling whoever else has happened
to look up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[what is it I might say
there in the orange light of early morning,
in the owl’s resting time,
that would have any pluck and worth in it?—]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Finally, I noticed enough.

which was slashing along as usual,
shouting and hissing
toward the future,

turning its back
with every tide on the past,]]></document>

is it a snowy egret
or a white flower
standing

at the glossy edge
of the lily-
and frog-filled pond?]]></document>

to improve their peaceful
emptiness]]></document>
