		<document><![CDATA[@telford_gurl @DBpsychology Schools have responded very well to this. A lot of teachers find it difficult to cover topics such as SPHE/PSHE in their busy school week so principals have described this program as a breath of fresh air! #mentalhealthhour]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@DBpsychology @MentalHealth_Hr We deal with a number of needs; anxiety, low self esteem, bereavement, poor social skills. We treat everyone in the group as equal and each week choose two "chief warrior" that direct the group by reading out the rules and tasks. It's a team effort! #mentalhealthhour]]></document>
