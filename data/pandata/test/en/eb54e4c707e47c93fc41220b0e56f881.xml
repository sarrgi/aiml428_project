		<document><![CDATA[@WEAGLEMAN You seem to lack a fundamental understanding here.

There *are* LGBT movements. But LGBT people don't inherently constitute a movement in and of themselves.

Ya dig?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WEAGLEMAN Yes, I can see your logic taking shape now:

		<document><![CDATA[@WEAGLEMAN LGBT people aren't a political movement. They weren't created by a third party. They're naturally-occurring humans with an identity that is as much a non-negotiable part of them as skin colour or background.

Suggesting otherwise is dehumanizing and--you guessed it--homophobic.]]></document>

Homophobia: "gay people are part of a conspiracy to hijack government borne of organized labour, and not actually what they think/say they are."]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WEAGLEMAN You seem to be struggling here, so let me break it down for you:

"Gays aren't people, they're a political movement created by organized labour" isn't an evidence-based counterpoint; it's homophobia. If you don't want to be "labelled," don't say things that earn you that label.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@WEAGLEMAN @RayLee143949 @11_marlies @OntLiberal That is not the key message. Not really.

		<document><![CDATA[@WEAGLEMAN @RayLee143949 @11_marlies @OntLiberal LGBT people aren’t agendas, they’re people. And they deserve to be reflected in their curriculum.

		<document><![CDATA[@WEAGLEMAN @RayLee143949 @11_marlies @OntLiberal If you—presumably cisgender, heterosexual men—think that mocking gender identity while promising to repeal the curriculum *doesn’t* mean LGBT people will be removed (considering we weren’t in it before), you’re either willfully ignorant or living in a patriarchal fantasy land.]]></document>
