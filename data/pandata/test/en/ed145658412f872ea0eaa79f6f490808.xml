		<document><![CDATA[5. He screams back to the airport and gets me there in one piece (€110 instead of €40). He was a good man but he did take the pee out of my pronounciation. 6. Check in (no issues there until... 7. See picture (mine is the stansted flight!!!!) https://t.co/9Y9lzX97HA]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Commute home from hell. 1. Leave the office for airport allowing 45 mins. 2. Taxi arrives 15 mins late. 3. Get to airport; purse not in handbag (2nd time in a week I have misplayed it!!!!!) 4. Taxi driver screams back across town I get my purse (underneath a chair).......]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My taxi driver is laughing at me because I did not pronounce horrible, “horr-eeb-ler”. This is making me feel very stupid. But I am laughing with him 😂😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TraceyDontRock In principle yes. Why not. But it’s remembering the work-life balance ratio. Also accepting that if you do it you might feel very stressed for a while. A supportive partner is also important. X]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If it’s dry in the uk you can thank me later as I successfully smuggled it out in my hand luggage yesterday. It be grim here in Toulouse. ☔️]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Listening to #CNN as it’s the only English Channel I can find. My god, if there was ever a reason while @realDonaldTrump  will win a second term it will be because of the reporting bias. It is so intensely negative that it feels so wrong.

		<document><![CDATA[@Divine_Goth I see you but more scarily, who is the beast in the midfield? Would not want to take a tackle from him. Don’t think he would catch even me and I struggle to run a bath nowadays.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Charlott3_W @rvedotrc Yep. In time to come their views will just be intolerable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Charlott3_W @rvedotrc I take your point. Well made. Although our media outlets lack credibility in society nowadays IMO. Their influence will wither on the vine if they persist I am sure. Being indifferent to us is fine as long as they are not rude and treat us equally.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NikiMarieDawn This is indeed my cunning plan.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rvedotrc Do you think there is an all powerful anti trans lobby? What I see in the real world does not mirror the anti trans hate on line at all. Anti trans bigotry wrong no matter how small it is but I think social media makes it look bigger than reality. Just a thought.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Drowned by the rain but checked in and waiting for my flight to Toulouse. It’s going to be a long couple of days I fear but hey, it pays the bills. 🙃 https://t.co/wfDVfPIUml]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Talking to a girl friend after dinner last night about embarrassingly leaving a piece of toilet roll behind after wiping (foof). Apparently it’s in the urban dictionary “snatch worm”. I fell about laughing. So good to feel normal. #snatchworm]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[D'you know, at the moment I hate Sunday evenings. Deciding what to take to wear for the working week just drives me to distraction. Will be so pleased when I have finally moved.]]></document>
