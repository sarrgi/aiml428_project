		<document><![CDATA[6/ As part of this announcement, we have also publicly listed our criteria for voting in EOS in the interest of transparency and disclosures]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/ We expect to learn a tremendous amount from our experiences in the EOS ecosystem, and will use thar gained wisdom as we participate more actively in other ecosystems]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/ Given the above, we realized that participating in this ecosystem in a meaningful capacity would be beyond the scope of an investment firm, and warranted a dedicated and independent team

This also has the benefit of allowing Tushar and myself to focus on managing capital]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ EOS is far and away the largest blockchain - in terms of usage, market cap, liquidity, and others - and requires the most active and engaged governance, and technical infrastructure]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ Why are we doing this?

Because the role of crypto investor is evolving. Successful Investors will need to be active ecosystem participants who can help shape the direction of the networks they're invested in]]></document>

TLDR: When LTC was founded, it justified its existence as a way to experiment. Today, all those questions have been answered, and LTC is functionally useless

		<document><![CDATA[@bpforster24 Both]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bpforster24 yes]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bpforster24 If a system is meaningfully value-able, it becomes economically *irrational* to hold enough of the coins such that the probability of this occurring is high enough to justify holding any coins at all]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[7/ This is why I struggle with value-ing governance, even if governance should and could actually produce something more value-able than a system with poor/no governance

Governance is not fundamentally value-able

{fin}]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6/ This is precisely why companies report key metrics on a per share basis - this allows all shareholders and prospective holders to normalize aggregate metrics (revenue, expenses, etc)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/ But the aggregate value of a system is *not* set from the top-down. It's set by buyers and sellers in an open order book from the bottom-up.

The system will only be as value-able as *marginal buyers and sellers value it*]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/ As a system designer, it's natural to think about the system from the top down, and from this, it flows that a system with ideal governance (doesn't matter what ideal is for the purposes of this argument) should be value-able in aggregate]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3/ Now for governance

You can make the reasonable argument that governance is valuable (note that Bitcoin maximalists will disagree with this assertion) because governance allows a complex system to work in the long run to manage scarcity among a diverse, heterogenous population]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ This math works because you can value the annuity at the aggregate level, *and you can securitize it such that someone can own some fraction of the asset, and the fractional owner can also value the asset on a pro-rate basis]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1/ If your discount rate is 5%, you can value an annuity of $100 as $100 / 5% = $2000

Now, you can take that $2000, and divy it up into say 1000 shares, each of which is worth $2

Each $2 share is therefore entitled to receive $.10 / year.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[0/ The problem with valuing governance is a classic bottoms-up  / top-down asymmetry with regards to how to value it

To best understand this, let's consider something that can be easily valued: an annuity]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3// Obv this is making some aggressive assumptions, but I do believe that this type of analysis can generally support the idea of *much* higher staking percentages than 10-15%

Curious for your thoughts @VitalikButerin @VladZamfir @jon_choi_ 

{fin}]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2/ IIRC, stake un-bonding time in Casper is 90 days. If you look at this graph, this suggests that the *highest* percentage of coins that move more frequently than once every 90 days is about 40%.

This would imply that 60% of coins could be staked at any time.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[0/ Based on public statements, seems like Casper designers are assuming participation rate of 10-15%

Do we have any data to back this up?

If not, what can we use a proxy?

I have one idea]]></document>

Given that you have to do a public auction process for each TLD, seems like you could mandate merkle proofs from other chains to ensure consistency. A bit inefficient but can start with one chain and diversify over time]]></document>
