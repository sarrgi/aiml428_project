		<document><![CDATA[@PitmanSwords They were suspended as soon as the trial was confirmed. Do you recognize the sanction in that? They haven’t played in over a year. Another sanction. Probably haven’t been paid in full in that time either. You might need some forgiveness in your own life someday.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PitmanSwords I have just caught up on a story that broke today about a school in Cork where some boys behaved very badly. If it is "that school in Cork" you referred to, then it is a co-ed, vocational, community school. So I am at a loss as to why you reference private, schoolboy circles.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PitmanSwords Praise from Caesar/‘Pitman’ is praise indeed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PitmanSwords Who said it should? What is your problem? Remember private school kids are like any others, they probably just have fewer sun holidays to go on than  many kids whose families spend their money differently.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PeterReilly123 @PitmanSwords Nobody could be remotely happy with the case or its outcomes. Some are better than  others. I have lots of empathy for all parties in this sad affair. The implications of this case will roll on and have implications in both jurisdictions on many levels for years. Be good, mate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PeterReilly123 @PitmanSwords No I don’t agree with your depiction because I have experienced a wide spectrum of opinion on this matter. Plenty of it contrary to your assertions. I also have the experience and wisdom to know that they who shout loudest are rarely the majority.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@_SomeDad @TodaySOR That is your view but they were found not guilty of sexual assault. Almost all democracies have judicial systems that provide for trial, punishment and review with a view to rehabilitation and second chances for most crimes, including sexual assault.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SeamarN @TodaySOR No, I do not know that. It was the view of the jury that sat through 9 weeks of evidence that they were not guilty of all charges.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_SomeDad @TodaySOR Yes and that's wholly wrong wherever it is or was practiced...but even the bad old RC church held out forgiveness for wrongdoing...the pious online mob just roams around looking for heads in all circumstances...but they can, because they are perfect &amp; many are perfectly anonymous]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@PitmanSwords But you don't mind them playing for Ulster?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PitmanSwords Not to me it doesn’t. It infers some guilt. Let’s agree that they were cleared of all charges. It doesn’t mean they are perfect either.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TodaySOR People give out about the Catholic Church being all pious. At least they have a process of confession &amp; forgiveness. The mob are just about hell and damnation.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TodaySOR Cue the mob with ageist remarks re Willie John McBride who has the whole thing in proportion. Found innocent by a Court of Law, the players shouldn’t be fired for distasteful private remarks or because a sponsor takes fright. Soon there will be no players or sponsors if they are]]></document>
